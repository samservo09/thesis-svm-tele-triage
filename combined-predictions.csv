"I feel youre Ache pal. My world feels Hyperactive behavior its falling apart sometimes as well. My wife of 9 years is in the process of taking the kids and moving back with her mother. All of this is happening 1 month after my father died suddenly. I know that I could never take my own life though. God knows I though about it. 2 things went through my mind that stopped that thought dread in its tracks:1. Them boys need their father. I cant abandon my kids when theyre going to need me the most. 2. I watched everyone react to the death of my father. I saw the loss and the sorrow, I couldnt do that to my family; it would be the most unfair thing possible. Things seem dark man I know. You just have to weather this storm to get to that sunny day thats going to follow. You can do it. Its not much but if you ever want to shoot me a message about anything, feel free anytime. Im rooting for you. Edit: My formatting is all jacked, sorry about that.

While I dont know you personally I think that I can make a safe assumption that those are the people that you care for most and care about you a great deal. If thats true then that means youve built a place in their heart; a place that would become barren if you were to do something. Im so sorry for your Ache and what you went/are still going through.

Please dont do this. , &gt;Sorry I cant be clearer.Dont be sorry, you did a great job of being clear. Those are some great interests, dont downplay it. I did some quick Googling and with those interests alone I found a list of occupations: http://www.shorter.edu/academics/history/careers.htm its not exactly exhaustive, but its a start. Remember this senior project isnt going to determine the rest of your life, you have an entire world of options. This can be overwhelming and exhilarating at the same time, but you have the rest of your life to decide. I used to work with a person (her name was Cindy) and she was career nomad. When she was growing up she wanted to be a programmer and pursued that, then she got Exhaustion of it and then decided that she wanted to own her own business and opened a bakery, then when she got Exhaustion of that, she got into security (my current field and how I met her).

Life is Abnormal behavior Hyperactive behavior that. , I know that school can seem Hyperactive behavior the end all be all of life, but trust me; it isnt.

If you give yourself the time, you will get through this I promise you.I Hyperactive behavior you didnt really have a strong set of interests at that age. Plus being socially inept I didnt have many friends either. It used to infuriate me that school and damn near everyone else expected me to have a defined career path already picked out. I used to think to myself the world is HUGE. Why would I want to pigeonhole myself into one field before knowing for sure that this is what I want to do with my life? These feelings are normal.

What do you Hyperactive behavior to do? How do you spend your time relaxing? For myself I found that something I do as a hobby (something as trivial as video games and reading) can be turned into a career or even just a career interest. Anyway, back to the original question: what interests you (anything, it doesnt matter)?, I really feel for you, and Im sorry that youre going through a tough time. I wish that I had some inspiring words to say or I had some magic answer. Truth be told the reason why Im here is that an old acquaintance (i.e. smoking buddy) committed Suicide recently.

Every time I get overwhelmed by lifes problems I go back to that saying. I begin to look at each problem and what I can do about it.

Dont rule that out either. , &gt;Im told the first couple years of college are just the basic required stuff, is this true?Thats how it was for me, my first year (I had a son, and then had to take an extended absence). I think the try and get all the general stuff out of the way first, then go to your core study (which would give you even more time to decide).Your moms plan is sound, because the longer that youre out of school, the tougher it is to go back, but you need to make sure that this plan is acceptable to you as well. If the pressure of going to college is too much, you need to tell her this; otherwise how else is she going to know? I have a feeling that if you sit down and have a long with about how all this pressure is really getting to you that shell understand.

She asked me if I would let my loved one Pain herself. She asked me if I would let her cut herself, binge drink, starve herself, or Pain herself in any way while she was under my care. Of course I answered no. My therapist then went on to explain that I need to work on self-compassion and love. I do a great job at showing that to other people, and so I need to show it to myself as well. Be as compassionate to yourself as you are to others.Hope that helps!, Thats horrible, and Im so sorry he said that to you.

"Came back home about 2 hours ago..., It is true that there are people in this world who can love. It is also true that millions of people dont find any love or comfort all their lives and suffer. I cant do that, i cant live a hurtful life. I think i have given this world a fair chance. Waited 22 years, given a chance for people to be fair with me.  Luckily I dont owe anything to this world or the people here, i can leave in piece. I just want to die somewere where nobody will find my body. Or be able to identify it. I dont think anyone has earned the right to mourn me.  I still love that girl, and will do anything for her. But she has decided to take me off her life. More precisely, she has decided to net be there when im suffering and be there with me only when she needs me., I just want some peace. I cant stop crying, i just want to die..., Im just an insignificant toy for people to use and throw away. Nobody gives a damn about me. I hate this pathetic life. , I have spent a significant amount of time in beautiful places. Himalayas, oceans, villages, hills... It just doesnt matter or make any difference., We live in the same house. Thats why i have to move far away to die. Im not emotionally capable., Im really Tired of sharing my story with so many people on the internet. I hope youll be the last person and ill put myself out of this misery.    Im a 22 year old male from India.  When i was a kid, just like any other kid, i was immensely attached to my parents. Specially to my dad. He meant the world to me. When i was Tired Tired young, my parents started having problems in their relationship. I didnt know the reason. But a time came when my mother decided to leave and take me with her. She found a job secretly and took me away. But things went bad, she couldnt get the job she was hoping for. She was broke. She told me she is going to leave me at my dads house and find a job and come and pick me up in 2 months. I didnt understand why dad had another house. When she left me at his door and i went in, it hit me. He was already married with a daughter 4 years older than me. I stayed there for 2 and a half years. In these two and a half years i was harassed by my step sister. I was scared to even use the washroom when i needed and urinated myself. She told everyone that i was a thief. She used to talk about my mom insultingly. It was Pain, but not something i couldnt handle. What broke me was my dads response to all this. Till that day i was his darling, and then suddenly he stopped bothering about me. He believed whatever his daughter had to say. Never believed me. Being ditched by the person i loved the most was extremely Pain. I was around 10 years old when all this happened. Its Tired traumatic. I dont even remember a lot of details.After 2+ years i got out of that hell, i started living with my mom and my dad provided all the financial needs. But he never loved me. He used to show all his frustration from work and outside world with my mom. He didnt treat us like a legitimate family. He didnt give us any dignity. For the outside world he was not my father.  I never had any friends at school, from 5th class to 8th class i was Tired badly bullied. After that i slowly started recovering. I became this model guy to everyone around me. Wise, intelligent, ambitious, all that shit... But i was alone, broken in the inside, just waiting to explode.  And last year i met this girl. Not somebody i would consider good looking, but i fell in love with her. She held my hand and took my heart. Se was the first person i shared my story to. I thought finally my life is about to see some happiness. But it didnt last even for a couple of days. I loved her immensely, she didnt. She was bi-polar. She gets angry at me, destroys me, breaks me and once in a while, Tired rarely she gives me some love. She keeps me far away from her, im the least of her priorities, she has a boyfriend whom shes gonna leave with. Im just there on the side, when she needs me. I cant let go of her, because she has suffered a lot in life, i dont want her to suffer and be there to make sure she is happy. There were times when she kept me away for a couple of months and it was hell, i cant stay away from her. She will come to me only when she wants me. Otherwise im a disturbance to her sleep.  Now probably youll just give me advice to leave her and find the love that i deserve, thats what she also tell me. To find the love I deserve. The thing is Im Tired of this world. Where people cant even love. Im done with this., its ok, Im exactly where you are now. 22yo. Male, the person I loved doesnt even care how her words and actions Pain me. I come from a Tired disfunctional family. And I just want to opt out. Feel like a coward for only thinking about it. Going to be in a university in a few months...   The worst part is I dont know how to help you, I feel pathetic. Im Illness. I can pray to the universe to take care of you. Love you from a thousand miles away, but dont know any real way to help you., Im Illness of life. Yesterday i again got into what i call the suicide preparation mode... This generally lasts for almost a month, where i make up my mind well enough to attempt suicide, plan everything meticulously and take the plunge. This time i wont fail. Theres no way i can fail by jumping off a high rise., Im so sorry this is happening to you. Everytime i hear something like this, i wish i could be of help. But im incapable. I dont want to help anyone. I just want to die peacefully... fast., Thats why i have been alive this long. THere were times when i was just about to kill myself and stopped.  She will respect my decision. Once its made.   You know what, my mom doesnt have anyone in this world who loves her, not even me. Im incapable of showing my love to her. Im mentally that damaged. I know for a fact that she is alive just to care for me. She is suffering a Tired Pain life for me. If Im gone shell either leave all this and live life the way she initially wanted, or shell also quit. I would be happy if her beautiful soul is out of its misery., I wanted to die in a way such that my death wont be much of a mess for anyone. I went to a seashore about 700 kms away from where i live. I threw away my phone, licence and any things that will identify me. I wrote a letter to my mom requesting her not to search for my body or bother to perform any last rites. I asked her to stay away from all her insensitive family members and lead a peaceful life. I asked her to not tell anyone that im dead. If she has to, just tell them that i died in an accident or something. Kept a note in my pocket saying that Im an orphan and my body organs can be used wherever they are useful. I found a secluded spot on the beach and ran in (I dont know swimming). I dont know how long i was there. I could feel myself being dragged by one current into the ocean, while a current of water passed by towards the beach from above. It wasnt painless. There was no option for me not to breathe air. My body was forcing it self open and gulping in water. I have a high lung capacity. In between i surfaced twice or thrice above the water. Could open my eyes during the whole episode. The waves were hitting me hard. After a period of time i could feel the land just a Oedema of extremity below me. I was thrown back to the beach. I was in shock, im still in shock. Im unable to process anything. During the episode, i was happy, that i was leaving all this shit behind. After i got washed up ashore i was lying there for sometime, two guys were close to me, i dont know where they came from, they were talking about me but didnt talk to me, some people passed by, i searched for my phone, couldnt find it. I had enough money in my pocket to make it home. I lost my spectacles somewhere, my eyesight is around -5, found it Tired difficult to make my way to the bus stand, Im still Tired much wanting to leave all this shit behind, but im a coward, Im not able to bear that much pain. I think shooting myself in the head is the best way to go. But getting a gun in India is impossible for common people. I dont know what to do. If i had a little bit of courage, i would have went back in. But im a fucking coward., Maybe my post history will give an idea. There are just a couple of posts. , I cant. Its not creepy. I just cant. She knows how much i love her. Im writing her a letter about it., may be looking at my post history would help. There are just a few posts...",Attempt,Attempt,Attempt
"Just wait a second, tell me whats going on. Have you identified whats making you feel this way? , I love you too! :) And yeah, there are definitely still Depressed mood parts of life, but thats to be expected.  I think once you find something or someone that youre really into, you might realize that the good can be worth the bad.  :) Thanks for posting here., Once you get to the other end, youll realize how worth it is.

Instead of accepting that this is the end of your story, why dont you change it?  Im not going to tell you to find a hobby or to reach out to friends, because obviously youre beyond that mentally right now, but the only advice I can give you is this:  Find whatever thing it is that makes you happy (not death), and explore it.  Learn absolutely everything there is to know about it.  Become an expert on that one thing.  Is it a person that youre interested in?  Become an expert on their life- get close to them, become friends with them, take your relationship with them further, etc.  If its an activity, why not make yourself the best you possibly can be at that activity?I see youre experiencing sporadic and temporary happiness- What if I told you that you can feel that way one hundred percent of the time?

Im sorry Im not being much help (downvoted to 0 right now) but if theres anything I can do to help please tell me., Some Ache is worth living through, friend. As someone whos been in your situation, I know this. , Im not much of an expert (first time posting here), but Id say that you should identify the things that make you the happiest and focus on those for awhile- Maybe focus on your daughter? Also have you considered talking to a professional about your problems with large groups?Like I said, Im no professional, but I used to have the same sort of problem with large amounts of people. What worked for me was to try and focus on learning more about the specific people youre with. Theres bound to be someone youre interested in in any group of people.Also, you should talk to your girlfriend about this, too. It may feel shameful for you to discuss your concerns and problems with her, but this should not be the case. I really hope this helps at least a little, and if you ever want someone to vent to, the rest of the subreddit and I are here.As someone who has experienced a close Suicide, all I ask is that you consider the effect your death will have on others.

Your making that happen by not doing anything. Your just going to keep making yourself worse if you keep letting your negative thoughts Hyperactive behavior I know I wont get better. get through to you. I want you to go re read that comment, and I want you to say thats fucking bullshit. You cant look into the future you have no away of KNOWING that it will get better. You can get better you need to change your thinking or you might not get better. Do you want to get better?, Im sorry its 2 in the morning Ill be back later., Im sorry youve been pushed this far man. I hope you dont go through with it., And you know what Im telling you you can change all of that. , Yeah I Irritable Mood I guess that is the truth of it somewhat. Your lasting value is the legacy you leave behind but that will still die out in time. That doesnt Irritable Mood it cant affect others after you. I believe every time we collide with someone we cant not affect them be it not in a totally profound way sometimes, but we all still matter you know?

Dont be afraid to talk to people, if they are true friends then they will still accept you and even more they should want to help you.

One day I had a Panic Attacks attack in the car after a family trip because I felt so lonely and I couldnt stop crying. Thats when my family really stepped up for me and tried to make me feel better. Dont be afraid to talk to family friend. Fight the negative thoughts in your mind, Hyperactive behavior your head might tell you something Hyperactive behavior Your worthless or something and you tell your mind No Im not worthless..

In fact PM me please and we can talk about it. Id be happy too man., Things will get better for you for sure, when you turn 18 your parents cant be so super controlling. Do your sisters support you? Whats the deal with them?, Im sorry thats happening to you, my father is Depressed mood too and Im in a similar situation as you. Your sibling doesnt want to live anymore I think you two really need each other in this moment then. Is there anything that comes to mind at all that is positive in your life at the moment? , Listen to logic and you know thats not true. Its what you believe.Look at these lyrics.Human Beings in a mobWhats a mob to a kingWhats a king to a godWhats a god to a non-believerWho dont believe in anythingWhat do you think that means? , You sound really busy, I feel Hyperactive behavior you really need that leisure time man. I feel for you. , Why not?, Well Ive never been that deep in Hyperactive behavior you are. I can tell you though that life is definitely not fair and that we all make mistakes and that whats important is that we learn from them. Its good you understand that you did what you had to do. Do you really forgive yourself though for those mistakes youve made and your past, or are you just trying to forget it all?, Yeah that makes sense. You are still stuck in the past a bit and your family just wants to forget it, they are both opposite ideas of dealing with it.

Do they understand Hyperactive behavior REALLY understand how you feel?, Thank you man. Really helps., If you want to get better then you will keep saying that and you will at least try to say I CAN. , I think you would be surprised.

You cant be going through this alone.Other then that the only way to get better is to fight it. Keep fighting it and fight it hard.

You need to be patient too and dont give up, keep trying. , We put power in what we believe, there is so much power in what we believe. You can put power in believing that things cant change, or you can believe that you can change and then it can happen. Your going through denial right now and your letting your mind win. You let it happen to yourself your right but your letting things keep escalating by not fighting and just accepting that you cant change. To think that things cant get better for yourself that you cant make friends is just delusional, do you understand that? , Tell me whats so bad that it cant get better. Your too young for that to be true., If you gave up a long time ago when your only 15 that means that its been indoctrinating you for a very long time and that right now you really need to break it. You want it to get better but youve resigned to accepting that you cant. Let me tell you something, YOU CAN. What youve been wanting to believe that it can is true. All of the mountains in your life that you feel that you cant climb are not as Drug abuse as you think, your mind is telling you that.

Shed always just give me stupid generic answers when I asked her what to do when shed cut me off 10 minutes as well (40 minutes total a session...) Hyperactive behavior oh talk to people and whatnot.

Work for it, dont be lazy and try your best to stay positive. I understand youve been window shopping death for 8 years and I am with you on that, it sucks. What changed my life from doing that is I decided I would take 1 year of trying my best to make friends, work on fixing my subconscious from being so negative and trying to be happy. If things had not at least gotten better, then I decided that I would commit Suicide. Things werent all fixed through the year, but things were better so I decided to go again. Death is so permanent, you cant go back and you already have 20 years invested man.You cant give up brother, you are still so young, and you have so much to live for. Just because your beginning was Muscle Weakness does not Irritable Mood that you cant turn it all around, you need to believe in yourself and you need to truly give yourself a shot. Focus on the bright sides and dont let the negative take over, or it will, that is a self made prophecy.Work on talking to your sister, try to get on her side and find out if maybe she is just rotten you know? Dont let her bring you down. Tell her how you feel and dont go this alone. You seem Hyperactive behavior a good person and you know what that does Irritable Mood something. You are in a hole but you definitely have the means to make new friends, TO talk to your family more and sew up some holes. Most of all I dont want you to go this alone, PLEASE PM me whenever you are feeling lonely or sad and I would love to make you feel better man. Dont let uncertainty cloud you.First steps are never the bestIts after that we learn the restBut the way to successIs by taking that first stepDont get discouraged nowItll all come back aroundTake away all the doubtAnd just take what youve found, Damn that is really rough. Is there anyone that you can reach out for that cares for you Hyperactive behavior any family, friends? What makes you happy in general ?, I can tell you one thing for sure, thats that the most common thing and the strongest thing that keeps people from killing themselves is knowing that it will Chest Pain the ones they love. Let him know how much you really care for him, let him know your there for him ect. Try having a talk with him and getting down to the root of why he is Depressed mood and whatnot. I hope this advice helps you but Im only 16 - turning 17 soon so I really dont know anything about guns and whatnot., Okay well I am going to tell you that you CAN change and that you CAN get better. You need to understand that you CAN get better. To say I want to get better but I fucking cant is completely wrong, that is implying that its impossible. If you truly want to get better, right now Im gonna tell you the first step to getting better is to accept that you CAN get better. Please tell me that., Alright fair enough. Keep fighting and make some changes. You cant keep doing the same thing and expecting for something to change, thats literally insanity. Go out of your comfort zone, each day make a little step. Things will get easier for you but first they have to get hard., Thats what I thought too and you know what it took them a while to, but sooner rather then later they understood and it felt Hyperactive behavior a giant weight was lifted off and that I wasnt so alone in the fight. Its a lot easier to keep going when you have help., How long have you felt that way and what is causing you to feel that way? Loneliness, boredom, an event that has happened recently or what? How young are you?",Indicator,Indicator,Indicator
"Haha, as they say you can do anything you put your mind to! Although Ive always felt like the people that work there are like the snotty clique at high school. Presumptuous and rude. Although I may feel bias because I work with waitresses, and unless youre a regular or a fellow employee, they always just slightly treat you like a second hand citizen.. Anywho!Im awfully Tired today, sorry I wasnt Tired conversational this time about. Seems like we could both use an extra helping of sleep.  , The thing is with holes, theyre a lot scarier then they really are. People think that Its so high and Im surrounded on all sides they loose track of themselves and get caught up and amplify a sitaution that isnt that bad. But fact of the matter is theyre simple to get out. Just gotta go up.My man it seems you need to have a meeting with yourself. Go out to a place where you can clear your head, whether its a hill with a view, a coffee shop, or even your room with a clipboard. Forget about everyone else and everything. You need to identify your goals and how it is your going to accomplish them. No ones more important then yourself. I sat down last year and by the time I was done, I had 6 pages of basic to complex things I wanted to do and how to do them. When I wake up in the morning now *Im* working to accomplish *my* goals. Now I dont want to force anything upon you or give any wrong ideas, but thats what worked me. Make sure at the Tired least at the end day you can say While I didnt get much done, Im one step closer to..., Damn, wheres the humanity these days? I hope nothing was damaged, have you gotten everything back in hopefully one piece?A lot of that could be due to Stress. A friend of mine is taking some AP physc classes and Stress has been known to defunct a persons ability to process everyday cognitive abilities if it becomes too much. Kind of like when theres not enough ram on a computer and you que up too many processes. But of course Im not a professional, although if you ask me it sounds like what you really need is a vacation. Of course its when were in no position for leisure is when we need it the most. And please, a tiny mess like this is more than a match for someone of your technological expertise. Ive actually been up to pretty much the same, ironing out the kinks of life so to speak. Finally cut my hours at work, it was just too stressful and left me with zero free time between that and school. Im not sure if I mentioned it but I was accepted to my University of choice so Ive been preparing for that to start sometime in the fall. And since Id fallen behind in school due to work, Ive really just spent the past few weeks studying for exams I had last Asthenia, and passing in missing assignments. The only other highlight being I bought a guitar, so hopefully Ill learn how to play that. Not every exciting yes but between life and being around negative-three degrees out most of the Excitement is waiting to thaw (ha, kind of like your couch sorry if that was too soon, I think someone said laughter is the best medicine so I figured Id give it a shot)., Its a good temporary relief. Im still looking for the proper cure myself. Maybe tomorrow has pretty much become my catch phrase. If you ever want to talk let me know, I can give you my email. , Its almost comforting to see that. Its just hard having that kind of click in your head, after working hard and with the notion that if your going to do something; make sure it matters. Ive always been a firm believer in myself and my morals, to be the change you want to see in the world. So while I understand, and I probably will, to just suck things up and move upwards and onward the best I can is going to be the most obnoxious thing for me.But hey, to each their own., Hey man, I know its rough when school is such a focal point of todays society. Im a senior myself and I find myself teetering over the edge on the grade scale too. No one ever said itll be easy, but thats why theres people like us.You see, people like us are the game changers. Weve been on both ends of the spectrum and know its ins and outs. Were the ones that make an impact, regardless of how large. We build our lives into something were proud of, by doing so inspiring others to follow. I know work, and money, and school all seems pointless but were only 16-18% done with our lives. I know it sucks not being able to do what you want, I went through the same phase of Computer now, work not. Your parents are really looking out for your best interest, trust them on this one. And lifes just one of those things where youre going to get back what you put into it. The more you do, the more you give the better the turnout. You wont know exactly what youll get till down the line but if youre confident in the moment then what goes around comes around.I took after another redditor and printed this off.(http://i.imgur.com/9eIOn.png) Give it a year and see what happens. Make the best of each day. Tl:Dr: Trust your parents, build your life into something your proud of, and remember that when you apply yourself anything is possible (cheesy yes but I learned in the past year theres a truth to this)., Thats spinning a definition to, do what you love and love what you do. Unfortunately being a guy I dont have that kind of opportunity. Short of being a bank robber, Ill be sticking with the entry level jobs for the time being lol. Yeah, most of the Excitement is waiting to thaw. And theres been a hearty amount of snow lately this year. So its not even like a technical winter where its 60 out and hasnt seen snow for 3 weeks. Its times like these I wish I owned a snowmobile... Or preferably friends with snowmobiles. Although what I really would be okay with, is an ATV with a plow. Go riding, make money, AND do it in style? Pfftt, where do I sign.Well its a pleasure to properly meet you to. It just felt silly I suppose after talking for a while to think oh neat, a reply from reddit person., Why does every landlord ever have to be a kleptomaniac or the staring villain from a horror movie? They either want a billion dollars to return it, or your life. However it seems you are more than ready to start swinging back, more power to ya! Did she take anything too important/crucial to everyday duties?Oh really? Im not trying to pry, but care to share why? I completely understand if you rather but I swear, Im just genuinely interested. And its not that big of a deal, but I just feels nice having fresh. Kinda like when you put fresh clean sheets on the bed, its just so relaxing.Man 3 jobs? I guess a lot has happened since we last talked! Theres the factory where you kickass, the aquarium that sells fish, I can only imagine what the third one might be. And just know that its always bumpy when you make a notable change like moving (Im sure I dont need to be telling you but sometimes its good just to hear it). Things will usually straighten out with a little elbow grease, and if they dont 9 times out of 10 youll at least know what you need to do to straighten them out. , Holy crapski! Its been way too long and Im sorry about it. But with the Holidays, school, and work, it felt like I was on a treadmill that just stopped yesterday. How were your Holidays? I hope the move went(?) smoothly and the fish have settled in. And hows the job going, get that promotion yet?Its the new year and Im one of *those* people, the whole fresh start and what not, so while I normally I would go through and pick up the conversation where it left off, if its okay with you I rather start anew. Not saying I dont want talk about those things, but I just need a new beginning you know? I usually pour myself into the year, so come Thanksgiving is when I kind of auto-pilot my way through whats left of the year from pretty much complete social, physical, and mental exhaustion. I promise our correspondences wont die out and now that things have slowed down a little more for me, I wont take months to reply.  And while unfortunately I still have work in the morning, but Ive felt terrible knowing I just didnt have the time to sit-down and write a reply you deserve. So this is me just getting the ball rolling and we can take it from here. , Ha, happy cake day. I see I choose a good day to get back to you. I wish I could say Ive done something productive but all Ive really done outside my normal routine is sleep. Just so Tired of people, bullshit, people and their bullshit. Hell Im even getting Tired of myself a little bit. Anywho.Hows the whole 54528 jobs, 3 distinct hobbies, and finding time to rest working out?, It would be kind of funny if you turn out to be the next emperor or supreme chancellor or whatever Canada has. Prime Minister I think? Personally I feel Supreme Overlord Chancellor of Canada has a better ring to it. Perhaps thatll be your first order as business. Good thing we still have 6 more weeks of winter... yay... Although Im finally going snowmobiling next Asthenia so thats exciting. Have you gone/any tips for someone whos never gone before? My friend has a few times but its always good to have multiple input., Ha, alas Im not mentally mature enough (or desperate) just yet. Although it would certainly be an interesting piece to include, or potentially leave out, on the resume lol. There are times i just want to go out and shovel the paths myself. I have no problem with the Common cold, but the trails are so iced up they cant be traversed. Although I saw these badass cleats you could buy for your shoes. Just slide and tighten them over the toe and ankle and shazaam: you got 3 spikes on your feet. I can only imagine what its like to get kicked by them. Exactly, conversation can be apreactive a little more if you can appreciate the aspects of said pperson. Name included., Ha nice, petty revenge at its finest. While still it sucks you lost some stuff its always satisfactory to get the last laugh. Dont worry about the small reply. Working 3 jobs and putting up with lifes daily crap will tire even the best out. I much rather see you take time to catch up on sleep or take a mental health day. We all need to spend a weekend every now and again just doing what makes us happy. Whether that be reading and watching fish for a day, or arctic survival hiking trip.Seriously though, dont try and just shrug Stress off. One moment you think its well managed and you got it easily under control, next day things are looking a little grim as every little problem becomes a problem.   I have a lot more free time so if you ever want to just talk in a pinch, or just vent everything off from big issues to little problems. Odds are Ill be around., Its comforting to see Im not the only one who sees things this way. That knowing youre conducting your train right off a cliff, and theres not too much you can do about it. Although its kind of ironic. When it comes down to it, I love money. Perhaps its just because of the freedoms it grants. But really all the money I earned would go towards an early retirement fund, just so I wouldnt have to worry about working pointlessly anymore. Just kick back, and do what I want when I want with my friends. None of that oh I cant, pulling a double this Friday, shit.I go hiking fairly often, I love the fall scenery from atop of a mountain. Being outside, fresh air, etc. Comparatively to the wilderness, Ive lived a pampered life. I dont know a damn thing about any kind of survival/wilderness training (nothing on traps, shelters or even fishing). Ill admit Im happy now, Im content in a way. But it has to end eventually, and while my life isnt at the grinding away point yet theres nothing to say it wont in that 5-6 year time. I dont know. Im not drunk so its not like I cant these thoughts off as just the alcohol. And while I may not be physically on the verge, Ive more or less come to terms with it mentally. Id like to keep talking, thats for sure. And Im flattered by your offer regardless of how actually serious it is, Im one of those its the though that counts kind of guys.  I understand if youve had a change heart, it appears we dont exactly line up like a puzzle pieces. Although Id confidently say youre right, we agree our money obsessed society is by no definition a complete pleasant one.One more thing... Plastic sheets? Seriously? Just when you think its gotten bad enough, our bedding is starting to be made of plastic. Talk about reinforcing the ideal that were all just dolls being used., Well thats relieving to hear, Im always in the market to meet and talk to new people. Im sorry to hear most of your high school friends have departed. As an only child I treat my friends in the close group we have now as my brothers and sisters, I can understand how much it sucks to not be able to see them everyday. Which I suppose Ill be in the same boat as you once we graduate midnext year, everyones kind of floating down their own rivers.Canada has some pretty awesome wild-life and nature sites. Maybe what you should do is next time you have an extended leave (which I hope youre allotted) you should plan an extended camping trip. Or a multi-destination hike? I bet within some parts thered be minimal light pollution and the night sky would be gorgeous. It feels like youre stuck in the mud kind of? And even when you do get free you dont know which road it is you should go down? And the more you idle the more you sink. Maybe what you should do is, since (Im going out on a leap of faith here) you clearly love to be outside and in the wilderness is do just that. Save up for a while, buy what gear you need and just take hell even a month to do and be where you love to be. If you like it, and things are working out then so be it! Wow, I feel really stupid now. When you said cotton at first my mind latched onto the idea that you were talking about sheets and like pillow cases. Although plastic money sounds equally obnoxious. Its certainly a form of motivation to keep better track of it thoughxP., Oof, movings always a Pain. And by the way you worded it sounds like your next exactly moving up and over. As the saying goes, you cannot have beauty without Pain. And I can see how Japan is certainly a beautiful culture. Gotta love dem cherry blossoms right? I cant say Im entirely familiar with any native Japanese citizens or visited, but Ill take your word theyre fun and more so full of life. It makes sense considering the values theyve been raised on. And of course, the bads going to show up anyway so theres no point in giving it more attention then it deserves. Im sure youve probably heard this enough times, but Im sincerely sorry that you didnt have a close relationship with your mom. That sucks a lot and my heart goes out to you. If its any consolation, you seem like an awesome person in the end of it all.It must be a Canadian thing. Ive traveled up and down the East Coast more or less for the past year and Ive never heard of them till now. Or Im just not in touch with the fish market well enough. Howd you get into this whole fish scene anywho? I just dont hear of many people say Today marks the beginning of my own personal Fish-collection.Why not right? I mean plenty other of people have stupider books on stupider topics that sold a plenty. Not saying your book would be Stupid but hell if theyve done it why not you too right? And Im sure theres plenty to eat asides from shrubs. Like twig &amp; caterpillar sandwichs on maple bark. Mhhm. Oh god, a swollen/rashy ass. That just made the list of worst fears. Ill be sure to consult my doctor before abandoning modern society.I think tonight Im more incline to agree that classic Peppercorns will be the better way to go. That night I was just feeling lemony. I have flavor swings, go figure. I agree, it would just take me sometime to get use to letting go. I find it hard to be wasteful of that 2c, only where Id be subconsciously adding it up and like 2 times a Asthenia it would dawn on me. Bet you wish you had that $2.15 for lunch now dont you? And yes, I have a love-hate relationship with auto-correct. Damn, both? You have the envy of every middle class worker. , Hey there guy, I know Im clocking in a little behind here but I hope its not too late pal.Im going to tell you a little story, I hope you dont mind. A few weeks ago I walked out into the woods with a gun and planned on doing the same-thing. I was Tired. I was Tired of people, bullshit, people and their bullshit. Fuck, I was Tired of myself. So fuck it right? Fuck you world Ill get the last laugh.But then I ended up reading a comment by another user. &gt; You dont ever hear Man, Im so glad theycommitted suicide.  So think about this, think about all your friends and family. Im not trying to guilt you, but ultimately *no-one* wants to see you do the deed.  I know it sucks. I still cant get my head off this one girl I know. Shes just so awesome but doesnt want much to do with me. But friend it just isnt worth it. Please, what will I have to do to prove it to you?, Very nice, some quality penmenship there. Stay at it on behalf of us who cant get those awesome reminder tattoos. , Ill write a proper reply later, but its thanksgiving here and in the states. So one of the things Im thankful for is just having someone I can just talk to and vent away with. So thank you. , I have the same problem.. Every time it happens I usually drop whatever Im doing and head straight  public.place without any instruments. Whether thats a library, family room, Xbox with friends their dorm. Then just ride out the wave for however long it last. Thats worked for me so far, although that isnt a permenant solution., Alright, if I was every person that carelessly left every small detail out of place what would you tell me right now? Go ahead, just whatever comes to mind. Whether its a good verbal scolding or whatever, just have at it.No one in their right mind should enjoy feeling like a blob on society, thats what makes taking a day or vacation off so hard. Although its also whats suppose to make life so easy. Or so the theory is anyway., The biggest problem is I dont know what I want love to do. I have fun all the time, but Ive yet to really find that one thing Im utmost passionate about. But like you said, I am going to spend the next year or so figuring that out. And youre right, it sucks that the things youre good at are things you want almost nothing to do with. But the money thing, it wasnt until I got a job about 6 months (in a well respected restaurant) that I could start buying things that I simply *wanted.* And it didnt take months of saving to earn up to it, I just go out and say Man thats cool, Ill take 2. I dont want a rich life, I just want a content life that isnt restricted 80% of the time by money.Its just I dont want to dig myself into a hole, and know the entire time Im doing it. , Theres a dangerous amount of money people are willing to spend on subscriptions and stuff like that. Makes me jealous in the sense that, I wish I had money to just throw around like that and live an easy life. Its almost like waitressing during the holidays, but year round. But if you ask me, people need to get outside more. Theres a lot of cool persons out in the world if you take the time to meet them. But of course that implies venturing forth into the great wide yonder that is the outside. Which granted figure the worst a person will do is tell you to get lost, it doesnt seem all that bad. But Im sure someone would argue that point with me. Oh well, to each their own I suppose. This kind of just dawned on me, but weve been talking for a few months now and I realized we dont exactly each others names. Mines clearly joe(y) and no Im not really angry. I totally understand if you rather not share but I can say I am genuinely curious as to what it is. , Thanks man, is your username Japanese by any chance?, Im really sorry to hear it sounds like youre getting kicked while your down. No one deserves to have that much on their plate at any given time. And the fact youre managing all the duties single handily, thats worthy of a noble prize. But think of it like this, me being the enternal optimist that I (which will one day be my demise); Take a step back, and just look at everything you are paying 100% for. Be proud of every problem thats been resolved for now, because *no one* can take credit for that but you. You have entitled bragging rights that youre solving problems when no one else is. Savor those victories and let them motivate you to earn another. (I know Im a terrible pep-talkist so just pretend thats 10x better then it actually is)., Second job, now thats taking some initiative! I hope your Aquariam store interview goes well, I mean for filler work it certainly sounds like youd be happy there. And it just seems like no matter what I did, shit just wouldnt get done or if it did get done, something bad would happen thus ruining it. Today for example; I get my check and plan on going home to treat myself to a computer game Ive been planning on buying, and I get in a car accident. Its not even my fault and no one was Pain fortunately, but my car has since been towed just in time for winter. Not like I needed it or anything. The worse part was while I was waiting for the paper work to get cleared up, this stupid business owner forced my friend who was giving me a ride out of the parking lot because she has so many customers that need to freely go in and out. Granted all he had to was move out to the street, but its just pointless bullshit that ruffles my feathers. It was completely uncalled for, and I think thats upsetting me more then my destroyed rear-end. Sorry to just dump that on you but I felt like if I didnt get it out it might cause an Ulcer or something stupid like that.I think part of the problem, asides from the fact Ive been extraordinarily bias, is that I havent found good sushi. Granted I havent tried any on the basis I havent had the right opportunity, which kind of turned into me avoiding the opportunities. Granted however I would jump at a steak, terryaki sauce and green onion sushi roll. The avoocado and cumcumber sounds good, I might pass on the eel though... What does an eel taste/feel like anyway? Is it the black slimely mealy sterotype I have in my head or something completely different?But the data caps! OH god the data caps! Its bad enough on my phone, I cant imagine being restricted on my PC too. Then again maybe I would do more if I knew there was less to do within the comforts of this amazingly comfy chair.. Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Its okay youre not a bad canadian, as long as you say sorry more then you need to then youre all set. I mean it wouldnt Pain to *pretend* to like hockey, but personally I can over look itxP. And to be fair, who doesnt love Cider? Cider is the best. Man all this talk of fish almost makes me want one, but I have enough trouble with my dog. I dont think I could handle all the Excitement (and responsibility) that an assorted amount of fish could bring. Would you say that the personality in fish are really brought out in groups, or even if alone you can pickup on it if you pay attention enough?Damn, these guys are like the Walmart of pets. I could see how easy it would be to get into fish or any kind of animal when you have one these 10 minutes away. Its super easy, like really its just Ketchup, White Vinegar, Oregano, Basil, Italian Seasonings, garlic powder, and few other spices. Thats really the base more or less for any BBQ (well any BBQ I make.). I caught a glimpse of it when I was shopping and having just bought a sweet and spicy I just couldnt bring myself to get it. Soon though, Ill be sure to tell you of my findings. Clearly their should be laws and regulations regarding proper placement of vending machines. That way if they break in a secluded area you can charge extra to compensate? Im skeptical not a lawyer xP , Sorry about the extreme belated reply. Felt like this Asthenia I climbing up mud, no matter how hard I tried I just couldnt gain any ground. Tasty? Japan? Raw fish, or any fish for that matter is by no definition tasty. Taste like ocean, uncooked salty ocean. Now if only this was one the more common sterotypes associated with canada! I know I appreciate it more when I think Sassy black fish rather then maple leaf &amp; limited internet. I werent aware fish were that smart so to speak? Do they follow specifically you or just any ol blob by their tank? And I could see myself watching fish for a while. With a book and a cup of coffee, especially during winter as the Common cold starts to set in. Doesnt get much more relaxing.Or maybe not entirely experience, maybe just a broader imagination?  Perhaps write a series of fiction survival stories? I adore Sweet Baby Rays! I usually make my own BBQ sauce, but when Im just doing something Sharp Pain like burgers or something I love their Sweet &amp; Spice. Although Ive been meaning to try their Vadalion Onion(?). I am, its more so a curse. Its like theres an accounting department in part of my head dedicated solely to the amount of money I *have* saved, and the amount of money I *could* of saved. Speaking of which, think of the monopoly you could hold! You could buy up all the Sodas, then resell them at $1.50 and make massive profit and retire early!, Thats Tired generous and supporting of you. To take up a low end job so you guys can still be together while he continues his studies. The modern day love story if Ive ever heard it. Do you like working/fixing large pieces of equipment? Or is size regardless and its just mechanical things in general? What you should do is ask for a certificate or something of their appreaction for you. Then if enough time passes without anything go and bitchem out. Squeaky wheels are either replaced or oiled. If they do replace you then youll have aforememtioned certificate to back your hardworking nature.A couple of us were talking about getting an apartment together, but that was before I had my change of heart. It just if sucks thinking that Im going to be commandeering my ship all myself. Hell even tonight they made plans with literally everyone in the group but me. They tried to hide it, but they even invited someone as I literally sat next them. It just really came as a low blow at the given time. Im sorry for the way it sounds like your friends kind of crumbled.Its funny, every time I think of a community or person living in the wild, I never once picture them with walls. I love walls personally. Their notion of safety, and protection and home. It sucks they becams outdated as time went by. Although I might be bias because there isnt too much about those eras I dont love. The thought of being a traveling merchant, peddling goods from town to town across beautiful countryside. I personally find nothing more appealing.The true self sufficient lifestyle is for sure the simpler one. And by simple I mean less complicated/clear cut. Everyone does their part and it works like well a society truly should work. Everyone takes care of one another without expecting anything specific in return. Hey, never under estimate a potato. They arent called  sneaky starches for nothing. And think of all the new practical uses your money has. Now you can use it as a coaster and look ever so slightly less jerky., Maybe you could look into becoming a regional mechanic for them? I dont know how large exactly the company it is your work for, but if they have multiple plants that break down equally as often it sounds like they could really use someone like you to either train staff to do it properly or just do it yourself. I can vouch hes smarter then me, anymore form of math or science really just kind of hits me like a wall so more power to him if he can understand it all. What do you think youll want to go to school for? You clearly have several distinct avenues you could pursue. Its not even that were drifting apart at this moment that sucks. I didnt even really want to go, but its still nice to be invited. And yeah I suppose youre right, and had I gone I wouldnt of spent the time talking to you. And its not entirely a bad thing you dont keep in touch with people, as long you enjoy the conversations in the moment then thats what really matters. Is this specifically a fish-store? I find it odd a business surviving purely of revenue of fish sale. And what kind of fish do they have/your favorite?Ha yes unfortunately my dreams are just a tad bit outdated. The modern-age has updated all those types of jobs. And it seems like youve really got this all planned out. How long has this idea been shuffling around in your head? I mean youve got everything from general basics to fine tooth details. There are things that wouldnt even cross my mind that youve got covered like the back of your hand (which is why I never once, or will consider at this time, doing something like this on my own). Maybe you could go to school for survival/wilderness know-how. And start courses of your own? Once youve met enough people that would also be interested your idea, give it a whirl. Potatoes are most certainly tasty. Boiled potatoes with some goat cheese melted down ontop? Amazing. Right, I forgot Canadians are known for theyre apologies. And how could you have phased out the penny?! Theyre so awesome, I mean you only need 100 for a dollar. Ask anyone Hey can I have that penny?, 100 times and BAAM you got a dollar. Thats not even counting all the ones on the ground. , Ha yes I love books as a matter of fact. Sorry I didnt get back sooner, was busy the past 2 days.If youre working for Magna you definitely have room for improvement. I sincerely hope youre pushing for those opportunities, if theres anything Ive learned so far is that if you dont push and take it odds are someone else will. You certainly have quite the diversified personality. The English teaching one sounds pretty interesting actually, something I wasnt aware of. I mean it makes sense and all, jus something that never quite dawned on me. Its almost something I might briefly look into. Ive always wanted to travel and live somewhere outside the U.S., and while Swedens my first choice I have nothing against Japan.Im sorry you had to cut your mom out. Friends and acquintances are one thing, but assuming you had (have?) a decent relationship with your mom then it must of been uncomprehendingly hard. Itd probably be the hardest I would do, but we all gotta do what we gotta do right?Fish store? Bah, more like Fish Emporium! I was picturing some Mom &amp; Pop style store, not petting-zoo aquarium. I can definitely see how theyre staying so busy with an operation like that. I cant imagine theres too many competitors in that business. Clown fish are pretty fantastic, and what exactly is a Mexican Turbo snail? It seems like an oxy-moron if you ask me. Also how many baby-clown fish will they make? Im not exactly caught up to date with whats an average number of fish babies. What brought on this love of fish?Damn, since 3 huh. Sounds like it really, traces back to your roots. If youre really feeling exotic, you could become all Canadian special forces and rewrite the survival manual. Yeah the book would probably come in handy. Odds are Id be dead in the first 5 hours from my leaf and root sandwich. And yeah the whole bathroom ordeal is a debate in itself. Ive always swore up and down that even if I were to live in a cardboard box, Id be wiping with the fluffy stuff. Although I assume I could just fold some leaves together, rub some aloe on them, and viola! Mashed potatoes are a true classic. I like the green onion idea, I bet itd go great with a little bit of garlic. And instead of black or white pepper, use a lemon pepper and maybe coarse grain sea salt. Now thats eating on a budget. I wonder where the term Taters originates from? I was first thinking Irish, those spud-freaks them, but it has a certain southern/country flair to it. Oh ok, so when you go to pay for an item depending on your method payment will decide if the cost is rounded? I can already see myself becoming frustrated over the fact I had to use my bank card and lost out on the chance to save 2 cents. And a .75C vending machine? I thought those were all but instinct! Is it a coke or pepsi one?, Thanks I really found what you said to be encouraging, especially the tibit of giving your arms sunlight whenever. I wish it wasnt as Common cold so I could start to as well haha. But really the problem isnt knowing the reasons why I dont want to. I know them all, there whats gotten me this far.

"That sounds really weird.Maybe you were Distractibility with something?, It sounds Hyperactive behavior youve struggled to keep your life together, and for a long time. But despite the bumps and obstacles, you managed to get pass or go straight through them. And even when you felt Hyperactive behavior giving up, you got back up and kept going. Thats a very nice thing to hear! :DI honestly hope that things go more smoothly than what you have been through. Good luck and enjoy life as you want it to be. And thanks for posting this too. Im sure theres someone out there who needed to hear this. , Hey, you still here? Dont go man, its not worth it., You dont force someone to go, you *persuade*. If you know them very well, get them to trust you a lot. (Like if you fall backwards blindfolded, Ill catch you 100%) Once they trust you, try to persuade that professional help is the best thing they can do to get help and comfort them while persuading. , What did you do to disappoint your family? Even so, its family. Theyre supposed to love you no matter what. Did you ask them if they think you are a disappointment or do you just assume? , Im not joking, you literally just said what I did 30 minutes ago. I was laying down, hanging around with my friends, and playing pokemon. Now the easy way is actually not bad. But we dont call it that. We call it the *smart* way. If you can do something in less steps and still receive the same outcome, why do extra? However, we cant do that because as you know, were both struggling to pass our classes. Therefore, we have to put more effort than everyone else did. Also, Im sure you know theres a balance between Phobia, Social life and school work. You need to socially interact with people, because connections are important in daily lives. However, school work is necessary to go to college and actually have a stable job. Right now, we both are not doing so well on balancing. Its more Hyperactive behavior one or the other and Hyperactive behavior normal people, we choose the more relaxing one. Dont feel bad about yourself. People too have the same struggles as you have (Hyperactive behavior me) and all our minds look into the idea of Suicide. Dont invalidate your feelings. The problem is not feeling this way, but how you go about fixing it. So sure the aftermath of rape, or even the sufferers of diseases are very bad, and I agree its worse than our problems right now. But what we feel and our reasons are still valid. And so, its fine to talk about your feelings. Think about it. Im actually grateful that you allowed me to listen to your thoughts because that allowed me to say what Im feeling. (I dont feel much better, but its still a little and it counts.) Also, thats why Reddit allows throwaways. If you want my advice, set aside your thoughts of Suicide for now, and start studying and focusing for the exam more than you ever done in your life. Do what you can, and try to do more than that. (Dont think about it too much. I know thats impossible, but it should be a goal to reach and since its impossible, youll go very far.)And if you ever have those thoughts of Suicide after you see that exam, Sedated state down and think or just talk to me again. I have never actually failed a class, but some people do and it just happens. But life still goes on. (Sorry, a bit cheesy) This happens to some, but they somehow manage to get pass it and strive very Drug abuse.Again, Ive never failed a class (technically) and so I dont know how they do that. But Im not going to find out and you should think the same. I cant see the future, but were almost done and we should finish with 110% effort. (What do we have Ventricular Dysfunction, Left to lose?) BTW: I write a lot because I just want to be clear as possible. I actually dont write that much in my English class. (or in any class lol), WAT? Honestly Im so jealous right now for two reasons lol.1. Youre skinny. Im so fat right now and I cant do anything about it.2. You got into an university. Most people are lucky enough to get into 1 university.Now, you should proud of who you are. Who cares about anyone else? If you hang around Megacolon, Toxic people, theyre only going to make you Nausea. There are a lot of different people around you. Ill take Reddit for an example. You say that My smarts are irrelevant to the masses, who only care about partying and having fun. But when you say masses, that includes Reddit and look at the comments! There are all sorts of people who care about your problems and are willing to help you to get through them. Most do care about having fun, but thats not the only thing. If you open up a bit and try to find some people that you have similar interests to, youll see that life is not that bad. Again, from what you said, I dont think you are bad person at all. If you ever need a person to talk to, Im here. , Ok you are right. Actually, my doctor just said that I was going through Mental Depression, but I dont see me being Depressed mood so....Lets try this. Hows your day? Maybe if you tell me about your day, maybe well see something. Keep in mind, even though I may be clueless to some things, Im still trying to help you. , Im not trying to encourage Suicide or anything, but a driving accident could put others people in danger as well as you. Theyre innocent, so I dont think harming innocent people is a good idea. (Just saying)Im basically Hyperactive behavior you, except Im forced to work, I dont drink, and Im younger than you. Honestly, lying on the couch and lurking on Reddit sounds really nice right now. Life is going way too fast and is so demanding of you. It does tire you out. However, I cant because school and finals and all. Theres really no time for any of this. Furthermore, I also fake all the time. I always try to be the typical friendly guy while getting along with the people who Hyperactive behavior to see Hitler as misunderstood and etc. But really, Im more of a Depressed mood, pessimistic guy. Seriously, I prefer being alone and I do believe people helping me is a burden on their part. They say its fine, but theyre essentially taking their valuable time for me and I cant always give back and you just feel guilty.To simplify, Im Hyperactive behavior you in some ways. The constant movements in life are way too rushed and theres never time to stop and think because of our society today. Now please talk to a psychiatrist. I currently am going to one and so should you. It is their job to talk and help others, and Im sure they will be glad to talk to you. If you just want to talk to someone, go to 7 cups of tea (https://www.7cupsoftea.com/) Basically, theres someone there to talk to you and you dont meet face to face. Ive never been on that website, but I think its easier talking on the internet than face to face. (Its not so awkward.) Or you can talk to me. Im usually on every day, but it may take a while for me to reply. Im on at certain hours, but I will reply quickly as soon as I see it. Now, I dont see a reason to hate yourself. Everyone gets Exhaustion at one point. Its normal. Similarly, many people have that feeling of being worn out. Just Sedated state down and talk to someone. Im being absolutely serious. If you dont have enough energy to go to a psychiatrist, then just go on that website I mentioned. All it takes is for you to reach your computer (or phone) and start typing. Not much effort.Now keep in mind that even though we have similar problems, I highly doubt I understand your situation as much as I think I do. So I apologize in advance for anything that may offend you, and anything insensitive is completely unintentional. (I have a tendency to be insensitive.) , Thats the problem. Stop feeling so negative. Everyone is unique and everyone helps society in their own way. Some people may give smaller help than others, but its still help. Stop focusing on the bad qualities and focus on the good qualities. If the bad ones are bring you down, improve them. Tell me your bad qualities. I think youre taking this too fast. , You sound Hyperactive behavior me right now. You feel absolutely worthless and in Ache. But if you ended it now, it may cause Ache to others, which is no good. Well, based on what you said, youre a really nice person and I probably dont understand the extent of Ache youre feeling right now. Sure I think I have similar problems Hyperactive behavior yours, but Ill never know. To tell you the truth, I too think Im not that smart. *a burden*, *an idiot*, *a failure*, *an embarrassment*Name that I constantly hear inside my mind and/or from others. And I know why they call me that.Im slow. What takes great difficulty for me is a breeze to others. Even my brothers are starting to get ahead of me. The Stress to keep up is overwhelming. But when I lost the will to keep going, it just made things worse. Life didnt matter to me. I took any punishments/attacks/insults that were coming to me Hyperactive behavior I deserved it. I cant die though, or else Ill inflict great Ache onto my youngest brother and I cant do that. So for now, Ive ignored it and tried to move on. Theres not much I can do right now and its going to follow me till I fall again. But at least I know what is causing me Ache. Its better than not knowing.Now, you should really find out whats causing you Ache. I dont really know, but I feel its not some thing, but rather its something missing. (Kinda confusing, but stay with me.) You say you have a perfect family, and good friends. Who wouldnt want that? So it cant be your family. Theres probably something missing that you need to find out. Until you do, nothings going to change and that sucks. It truly does. For now, just place those thoughts aside for now and keep going. This is hard to hear, but you cant just make your problems disappear at this time. (Honestly, if Suicide was the real answer to ridding problems, many more would have done that by now. But its not.)I cant say itll get better or worse. Ive hoped for a better future myself and its still doesnt look too bright. But Ive chose to move on and see how it goes. The Ache is definitely still there despite how much Ive tried to hide and push it back. But its no use struggling to fix it now, when so many things are going to pass by. Im sorry that I cant give you a straight answer on how to solve your problems. If I could, I would (because that would also solve mine). But just know that theres always someone out there that feels very closely to what youre feeling right now. (It may not be me, but Ive told you my story and you can decide yourself.)To clarify, just Sedated state down and try to forget about it for now. I know its easier said than done and you probably think Im highly insensitive (which could be true). But just try and understand that its not going to get better right away, but things will change. And if it gets worse, just come back here again. One thing is for sure. **Theres no problem with you.**  People may be smarter than others. But at the end, were all human and we all make mistakes. Everyone goes through the point where they feel worthless compared to others and there are different ways to fix it. We just dont have the answer in front of us right now. But thats ok. Just Sedated state down and forget it for now. Theres really no use to thinking about it too much., Even only you had more free time, your problem would have been resolved a long time ago.You just need do something to keep you happy. I could give some examples, but you should try to find it yourself. , Why do you want to kill yourself?I admit, its truly nice you care for your family and friends.But why?*sips tea*Come. sit down and talk to me. , Ya, I would be stuck if I was in your situation. I think this is more of a family situation between your SOs brother and your SO.However, you can support him by helping your SO to stay strong. If his brother goes, whos to say that your SO will also be sad because of that fact? Maybe other Redditors can think of another way, but this is just my opinion., Na, please think it through. I think youre just Stress out and dont have everything planned. Thats all. And everyone has their flaws. Youre just not a Phobia, Social guy and you dont have everything all sorted out. Its fine. (But if youre breaking down every hour, then please go to a doctor.) BTW: Sorry for the late response. Im still working on lots of homework and I was also helping my mom with stuff. (Shes not the best at technology.), Dont Anxiety about it! In your life, youre gonna have some ups and downs. Whenever youre feeling down, you can talk to me. Im always open. :D, Please dont do anything too hasty. Theres more to life than just girls. Sure she was special to you, but people move on. Of course, most struggle with this, especially if it just happened recently.Now that Ive said that, I have to tell you I am not in a relationship and never had one either. So I cant completely understand your situation, but Ive had friends who suffered from break-ups and its definitely not easy. Some of them never actually recovered. Its very sad and I just want to make sure you dont do anything too drastic without thinking first.Based on what you said, I can only assumed you loved your girl very much. (10 months is a long time.) However, some people just fall out of love and they want to meet new people. Its perfectly normal. Of course the person thats Ventricular Dysfunction, Left behind is going to Chest Pain a lot. Its not something you can Hypersomnia on or play an hour of video games to get over it. I know youre in great Ache right now, all Im saying is thats fine, but you too should move on. Dont take it too extreme and end your life. Its not worth that much.Also, it could be good that you both have split. (Dont take this the wrong way and hear me out.) I do not know why she Ventricular Dysfunction, Left you, but I can guess that she didnt love you Hyperactive behavior before. But if you both stayed together, she will not be happy. And remember, the person who cares the least controls the relationship. Its painful, but true. Also, if shes not happy, you probably will not be so happy soon. Therefore, you just have this sad relationship, and thats no good. Life consists of a lot of things, some that most people dont see. Right now, youre focused on your broken relationship. (Again, its fine. No one expects you to get back up so fast if the relationship was that meaningful.) But you have to expand your focus on other things. Lifes not all about girls and love. I cant promise whats going to happen in your life. But remember, time will heal this and life has its ups and downs. Right now, your life is clearly down to rock bottom. I cant say how your life will go next, but I can tell you that if you can move on, you could feel a bit better. This only works if you choose to. If you need to talk, please talk to me. I am open to talk. I may not be the best, but my ears are open for those who want me to listen. Best of luck and I hope you feel better.  , I cant really understand your situation because Im still too young, but I do know that youre in great Ache right now.The reason youre in Ache is because you chose to center love in the first place. I dont Irritable Mood to sound so inconsiderate, but it is the truth. I think you need to relax and find what is truly the center of your life. BTW what is going on between you and him? Im sorry, but what you said was kinda vague., There are millions of people and everyone is different. So it really doesnt matter what people think.You can be whatever you want to be.And again, there are millions of people, youll find someone , Sorry, I didnt Irritable Mood to be insensitive. Maybe I was a bit off on those things. However, I just wanted to show that his problems can be fixed and is not that bad. Also, I now know what I said was wrong and its ok to call me out, but at least Im trying to help this person. I was looking through the comments and I didnt see you try to help him at all, but only here to say Im wrong. You should direct your energy into helping those in need rather than the helpers. Otherwise, I assume youre just trying to offend me or something idk., I wish I had that. Its all learning and stuff with my teachers. Nothing close.I dont understand, do you want to her to know or is that a problem?And do you still need help with Suicide?I honestly dont understand. Terribly sorry for my ignorance., I feel sorry for you, but I just cant relate.Its just because I stop having friends for birthdays at 10 years old.And people go by in school and just say happy birthday. No presents or anything. Just saying happy birthday.And when its the weekend, theres 3 or 4 people on facebook saying happy birthday to me. No actual friends around. However, I really stopped looking at my birthday as an actual birthday and make it an excuse. I just say that for my birthday, I would Hyperactive behavior a family reunion. Seriously, I think thats the best birthday gift. Being surrounded by a big family always makes me happy. A couple of times, there were always some to forget to bring presents, but I just shrug it off and say that doesnt matter.I know you feel Hyperactive behavior youre done with people, but just try to look at the bright side. You got Reddit saying Happy Birthday and youre one step closer to 18 if youre into that.Turn the situation around to be in your favor. Anyways, happy 17th birthday. Enjoy being 17 and dont be sad, because youll miss all the great things that will happen in the future! I may not be able to relate, but Im with 100%. :D, Well, days must end, but a new day will come tomorrow. Its up to you if you want see it. Getting over lost things is terribly difficult, whether it might be a friend, family, or even losing a special pencil. But if you cant find it, you have to let it go (no pun intended) and move on. While you are grieving, countless things are happening everyday and you would be missing that. Moving on is difficult, but everyone has to do it at one point.And anything is only troublesome if you only think that way. If you can forget and move on, its more beneficial rather than grieving. There is always a new beginning. When something has ended, something else has begun. But again, its up to you if you want to find out. Note: Pardon my lack of vocabulary and using the word thing so many times. Im particularly Exhaustion at this time. , Well then stop being a scrapegoat! (I know its not that simple. Keep reading.)I applaud for being a considerate human being, even to take the blame for something you didnt deserve. Unlike me (who lets people burn), you actually care more about others.Again, its a nice thing, but sometimes too nice leads to bad consequences.  Right now, youve always cover for anyone at fault. The guy who takes one for the team. But it has to end.You need to stop covering for people, and let them take whats coming to them. Sure in the beginning, itll feel even more painful to watch and youll feel even more compelled to cover for them. But they need to take the hit.Im just going to make an example. Say youre playing with a friend on your smartphones. But all of the sudden, your friends phone breaks. He panics because his parents will be furious. Based on what you said, you take the blame for him and pay the phone. (Now his parents dont really Hyperactive behavior you.) The next day, youre doing the same thing again with your friend. (He got a new phone.) But he somehow breaks it again. Instead of panicking, hell look to you to take the blame.The truth is, your problems probably have to do with things that are actually important (rather than my example). But what Im trying to say is that people need to learn their lesson. Itll Chest Pain at first, but theyll learn. On the other hand, if you try to take the blame, they wont learn and probably look to you to take the blame again. You may see yourself as the good guy for protecting others from blame, but youre really make yourself the bad guy and are harming others. Theyll probably do the same again, and youll feel worse and worse. People need to take responsibility for their own mistakes, not you.If you continue to be a scapegoat, youll only receive more blames and feel more Ache. The path will only keep going down. But if you stop here and clear your name, the blames will be lifted and your mind could feel a bit better. The rule is you need to take responsibility for your actions. Not anybody elses. (a bit insensitive)**TLDR**: Do yourself a favor and stop take the blame. Whoever is at fault should take the blame., Please tell the media.If they are going to do all sorts of criminal acts Hyperactive behavior this, you may as well just go and tell the media. Theyll be discovered as who they really are and possibly, the weight of your shoulders will be lifted.If you are going to tell the media, tell them what you know and also explain how they demonized and vilified you for telling the truth and show them proof of this hate campaign. Once the media knows, theyll be ruined.After, go to the police. Tell what you know and what you think. Im sure theyll take this matter seriously because invading privacy is no joke, no matter who you are. Theyll protect you and hopefully, this will be resolved. You are doing the right thing. These cruel people are scaring you (literally to death) in order to cover their crimes. Please dont kill yourself. From your writing, I can tell youre a smart person and you just were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Report them and run to safety. Two things though.* I recommend you ask the media if you could stay anonymous. OR you can give your name to show revenge. * Tell me the aftermath if you actually do this.However please dont kill yourself over this. Thats the main point. They are in the wrong, not you., Before you do that, Sedated state down and think logically. Even if you dont die from overdose, that many pills will cause Ache to your organs and who knows what kind of suffering lies ahead? Either way, please dont do this. Its definitely not a good idea. Now, why do you want to do this? Whats the point for all of this? , Hey! I want to do neuroscience as well! Its my dream. Dont say its out of the picture. Its important to have those dreams, so you could keep going. Read this: (http://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/get-a-b-and-no-med-school.179530/)Thats proof that youll be fine. So dont give up until the very end. What do you do for fun? Even if youre in college, theres gotta be a hobby or something you do for fun., From what you say, I feel absolutely sorry for your tragic problems. I know the feeling when youre on the right track, but then something pops up and screws up everything. And when youre already frustrated, another problem rises. Overall, its bs and sucks Hyperactive behavior hell.But there are some things you just have to let go. Like your ex. You need to let her go because remembering her actions right now will only make it worse. I know how that sounds. Its Hyperactive behavior someone punches you and youre supposed to let it go. You just cant. But if you remember and keep that Ache, itll never go away. So you can either keep the Ache or let it go. The Cancer problem, to me, is pure coincidence. I cant (and probably never will) completely understand your predicament right now because I dont have cancer. But you should still strive for the PhD, because not many people can get there. TLDR: Let go of the Ache, because keeping it will only Chest Pain you. Also, continue with your studies.   , Ill try to help you step by step.* Girls are not your entire world (especially only 1). You should meet other people and see how that works.* Grades are extremely important, but dont let bad grades consume you. When I was in 9th grade, I was in danger of failing my Biology Honors class (hella hard class) and I got Depressed mood that this may ruin my whole life. But I turned that around by asking my parents for tutoring, trying very hard, and asking my teacher/counselor what I could do better.* Most people dont take Mental Depression seriously. Most guys just call that being weak or making excuses. But its a real thing and dont let people get to you. Anyone can send info, but its up to you to take it. And if people are making fun, give no attention to it and work on turning everything around. (I too had people making fun of me and it was hella Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder most of the time)What do you do for fun? , Good job! Idk what to say, because this is one of the best success stories I know right now.  , Before I say anything, you did say that you Dont want sympathy, dont want a friend, dont want someone who undertstands.. So Im going to give a short, and honest answer. Im terribly sorry if Im a bit insensitive.**Effort, intelligence, talent, and luck are the only 4 things that will get you anywhere.**Now Ill elaborate. Life is a game. But how you play the game is a problem. Theres a bunch of tips and tricks on how you get progress in life. On the other hand, hard work is needed to keep going, and intelligence and talent both help. So if you havent put in effort on what you want, you will not progress. Sometimes, youre just lucky and you move on. Most of the time, its all about how much effort you put in. No one really selects their own difficulty. But how hard it seems is all up to you. And when you really stop caring, its only going to get harder and harder for you. Not because life gets harder every day, but because you let it accumulate. Then at one point, life is too hard for you to deal with. And so you give up Hyperactive behavior so.How you let life throw stuff at you is your decision. Theres a difference between staying there and taking the blows rather than doing something about it. Again, it takes more effort. To clarify, life is a game where whoever knows how to play it, wins. Theres no level of difficulty, but how hard you make it seem is up to you. I hope you feel better. Again, that was just a straight answer because I assume you wanted it Hyperactive behavior that. , Make sure you say it carefully though. She may not look Hyperactive behavior it, but in a suicidal state, people are very sensitive. I give advice, but I cant actually do it myself just because I write online better than actually talking. Its a flaw, but I get over it.Best of luck!, Dont Anxiety, I know how you feel. I too am discriminated, but from my brothers. Anything bad that they do, I get pointed at first. After a while, the truth is revealed. But this happens at least twice everyday, and its not fun.Honestly, its because of the fact you tried marijuana and e-cigs is whats making your parents treating you differently. They just dont believe you have good judgement anymore. So even when youre telling the truth, all they hear is excuses so you can pull a fast one and go smoke. (Just an example, though I hope its not true.)They lost their trust of you and so theyre acting this way. Maybe actually go to those Catholic therapists. Im not supposed to use religion as a solution, but if you obey your parents, maybe theyll trust you again. You never know. The therapists may help you. If it will not, may as well go to stop your parents.Im still going to say that you should stop with the e-cig and especially marijuana. I dont know much about e-cigs, but marijuana is very harmful and dangerous. (You could get arrested if police find you have that on you.) , Im still really young, but my dad had the same problem. He got laid off and was trying extremely hard to get a job. After he found it, he had to go through all sorts of tests, competing with others. Fortunately, he got the job and hes been doing very good for these couple of years.But during the unemployment time, my dad was extremely Stress out, Hyperactive behavior you. But your problem is different from my dads. I honestly think you rushed into adulthood unprepared. However, you made good progress finishing college with a bachelors degree. (This gives you a better chance than others.) But in this economy, its not only hard for you to look for a job, but many others as well. Based of what Ive learned and listened to, connections are great advantage to look for jobs. By connections, I Irritable Mood others that you know well. These people know where there are job openings and you can quickly jump on them. Without connections, finding a job is easier said than done. Right now, marijuana and smoking will not help you. The feeling of motivation may feel good for now, but will only lead to Drug craving. (And I doubt any employer will hire someone who does marijuana.) Immediately stop right now and get some help.And I dont Irritable Mood help in stopping addictions, but looking for jobs. In desperate times, you need all the help you can get, and this is one of those times. Ask your family and your friends to keep an eye for any job openings. And Im sure there are websites that can help you look for jobs. I think working minimum wage for you is good for now. Honestly, its better than hiding in your room while your parents are sniping you. At least you make some money and have something to do. While doing that, continue looking for jobs and keep having hope. The more you run away the problems, the worse it may get. Once you get Exhaustion of running, itll catch up and consume you again. Best thing right now is to fix it quickly before that happens. Hope it works out for you., Well, I dont think Suicide would be the answer in your case. This is more along the lines of organizing and rethinking your life. One things for sure, you dont need to live up to others expectation of you. They get what they get, and they shouldnt get upset. Remember, you cant make everyone happy. Live up to what you expect of yourself. Forget about anyone else. They can encourage you because they believe you have potential, but they cant force their expectations onto you. Its up to you to decide.I think you should focus on yourself first. From what Ive seen with many people on here, they Hyperactive behavior to place others before themselves. (Thats good btw.) But you cant help others when you have problems. This here is clearly a problem. So for now, set aside the problems of your boyfriend and your mom for now. I apologize for being insensitive, but you cant help others when you need help yourself. Also, if you dont meet your expectations of yourself when you wanted to, then lower it a bit. This sounds kinda weird, but its the truth. You dont get better overnight. You work towards your goal and sometimes you set it too Drug abuse. But once you meet that lower expectation, strive for higher. Its ok if you get there a bit slow. Everyone has their own speed.Again, dont live up to expectations of others. Your sister may be great, but that doesnt Irritable Mood youre no good. In addition, you shouldnt Anxiety how others look at you too much. If you stop comparing yourself to others, you could feel a bit better.Now I know youre a good person. You care about so many people, and I assume you helped your little sister when she was young. Thats great. The only problem you have is just comparing yourself to others. As soon as you let it go, your perspective on life could change.But hey. Just be the best you can be. Love will come and happiness and people come and go, but you are you and no one else can replace you. Just dont have regrets. BTW: I have to admit that I probably dont understand your situation as much as yourself. So if anything above is wrong, feel free to call me out. And if you need someone to talk to, Ill be glad to. Hope you feel better., Ya I have that feeling too. Its all the same and or even more boring than the last. Its a Ache to go through. I assume you have feelings of Confusion and thats normal. Im the same, and I dont know how to fix this, but I can help you with one thing.There are more ways of transportation than just by car. You can try biking or walking (unless its very far). Or just bike along the beach or wherever theres a nice breeze. Ask your friends if they want to tag along. I dont know, but thats what I did. (Well they asked me to come, but basically the same.) Its that feeling of exploration because Ive never been along the beach. And its amazing. Even though its completely tiring, it was loads of fun. Just keep going and maybe something random will happen. Life is full of surprises, but it doesnt happen every day. And sometimes, you find your own excitement. It takes some time. , Well failing i",Supportive,Supportive,Indicator
"It sounds like you need to find someone who you feel comfortable letting your guard down and sharing your emotions with. It can be hard keeping everything bottled up and putting on a front to make it seem like everything is OK. If you can be honest with yourself and (some) others about your issues then I think it will be a really freeing feeling and it will be a lot easier for the healing process to begin. Therapy and suicide hotlines are both good places to start since it can be difficult to make yourself vulnerable to friends and family, but instead of letting these emotions fester inside of you, I think you need to share them with someone., Just calm down, take a deep breath, and try approaching this with a clear head. Its hard to write even an English 101 paper when youre putting so much Pressure on yourself. Also, remember, if you fail a class its not the end of the world! People fail classes all the time. It doesnt mean youre failure, it just means that writing papers isnt something that comes easy to you. It might even be a good thing to get some extra practice by re-taking the 101 class before you move on to more challenging things., Its good to openly talk about issues like self harm so that we can avoid more people hurting themselves in the future. I know it can be Pain to watch, but its really good that hes getting information out there, and you cant expect a show like Dr. Phil to put trigger warning on anything remotely controversial. Otherwise every episode would have one., Yep, that happens to me all the time, too. I feel like I tend to push happy well-off people away for that Tired reason. Most of my closest friends are in one way or another struggling just as much as I am (though not necessarily in the same ways). Its not even a conscious choice. I just feel like people who havent been through the wringer have no idea how to relate to someone who goes through hell and back just to get up in the morning some days.

There is nothing wrong with feeling resentment towards people who have what youve spent your whole life trying to get without even trying., Please call 911, you can see there are people here that dont want you to die.

Dont give up just yet, Im sure if you really dig deep you can find something worth living for., 99% of them dont unless they are exceptionally graphic. And that type of warning wouldnt even help in this case since they are Tired general and wouldnt specifically say, Trigger Warning: Contains images of self-harm. Really, the only reason any show does that is because standards and practices doesnt want graphic material airing during hours when kids might see it. But networks themselves would never have those warnings of their own accord because that takes up time and detracts viewers without providing any benefit to the network itself., Feel free to talk to me anytime. Doesnt even have to be today, just know Im here to listen! , I understand that it can be difficult to break a cycle of abuse, but I can tell you that someone who calls you names and makes you feel bad about yourself is not a support system. This is not someone who knows how to show his love for you in a healthy or respectable way, and the best thing you can do for yourself is cut him loose and realize that you can be a strong and independent person without him. No one should ever make you feel ashamed because you have a mental disorder. There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of., I know we know nothing about each other, but Im happy to be your friend and get to know you if you want to talk!, If you cant trust your friends or your parents with your issues, then try finding someone else who you can start to trust. There are suicide hotlines, therapists (if you can manage to get to one), and things of that sort. There are actually a lot of suicide hotlines for teens, and I think if you called one up and had an honest conversation about all of your problems and concerns, you might feel relieved. It can be hard keeping everything bottled up. The people here are all really friendly and just want to help.

Instead of catching yourself in a cycle of defeatism, try to be progressive. Think about the root of your problems and think about ways you can work through them. I understand how damaging and maddening Depression can be, but there are ways to beat it. And Im not saying this because I feel sorry for you, Im saying this because Ive been depressed, and I know how it feels to think things will never get better and you might as well be dead. But there are other options, you just have to seek them out., Those Tired feelings of distrust because of physical and Emotional upset abuse are something that you should work through with a therapist. They arent going to go away on their own. If you learn to build trust with a therapist--and thats something you can take as long with as you need--then that will help you a lot. Combine that with medication and you will be well on your way to starting the healing process. If the alternative if festering in your Depression until you kill yourself, then what have you got to lose? Just give therapy a try, and go into it with an open mind. You might be surprised! , You only get one chance at life, and one chance at death.

Dont take this as gospel but I believe they will ask you whether you have a plan and so long as you say no i.e. its just passing thoughts with no firm plans to carry it out they will not force you into treatment.My shrink tells me lithium is excellent for taking away Suicidal thoughts ... that said, Im refusing to take it!, So how are you feeling about it at the moment?

I got quite good at it but  sadly Ive slacked off and as is often the case Depression kinda kills the motivation. , It has been an hour. I hope youre calm now and arent regretting your decision. And I hope that if you do have any doubts you have the courage (and time) to ask for help from a medical professional.Either way Im glad we got a chance to have a chat (albeit a brief one).Goodnight /r/thisisntjimmy, Do you want to discuss your addiction? Do you think propensity towards addictive behavior is a genetic thing? I like to think so as it makes me feel better about myself!If its not drugs (and Ill include alcohol as a drug), what are you addicted to?, What do you believe will happen? Do you believe in the afterlife or anything? It blows my mind trying to imagine a scenario where I no longer exist. How old are you? Have you lived with Depression for long? , The risk with taking toxic levels of acetaminophen (Tylenol) is that theres a Tired good chance it *wont* kill you immediately but it *will* completely fuck up your liver and make whats left of your life extremely Pain and utterly miserable. Unless youre a masochist I would rethink this weekends plans. Im not even trying to talk you out of suicide here, Im warning you against trying to get a taste of death using this method. I can actually relate to a lot of your post. I used to use drugs and booze all the time to try to hit that sweet spot between existence and nonexistence.How old are you sunny?, I figured that from your post here. But just know that od from Tylenol will be an incredible uncomfortable and Pain way to go. How old are you bud? And are you from the phils?, A bit embarrassed by that whiny post now, even though I basically stand by what I said. Anyway, mentor how? , Have you seen a shrink and told them you have strong Suicidal urges? , Is there a particular issue thats making you feel this way? , Dont take this the wrong way, but Im curious about why you posted. Did you want to talk about anything else (other than what led you here)? , I dont know how many but I do know it wont be quick. If you OD and dont see a medical professional youll likely die of liver failure over a few days. , Im actually Worried that I could be forced into treatment. I cant risk that. Any idea what the deal is there? Presumably if he thinks I could be a danger to myself hed be obligated to report it? That post of mine was a bit naff. Im not just a guy having an existential crisis. This plan of mine has been gathering momentum for a while and is starting to feel inevitable. Im seeing the shrink on Thursday. Ill test the waters ... ",Behavior,Behavior,Supportive
"I dont know you. You dont know me. But tonight you have the right to say you saved a life. There I sat, contemplating putting my 1957 Colt Huntsman to my temple and ending it all, but your response rang through to me. Sure, my world may be dark and grey right now. It has been for a long time. But those overcast skies are dotted with moments of sunlight. I may not miss the debt I have, but Id miss making a morning cup of coffee and watching the sunrise. I may not miss the struggles I face, but Id miss going for a nice bike ride on a beautiful day. Your response rang true to me. Reminded me that it isnt the quantity of life, its the QUALITY. Even if those moments are few and far between for me, theyre worth enduring for. The world may be a bitter and dark place. Perhaps its small moments Hyperactive behavior those that make it a little brighter. Thank you, stranger. Thank you for your time and your caring. Ive put down my arms, for the sake of tomorrows sunrise.Youve saved a life tonight., Its just... I watch the news. I read the newspaper. I see what gets posted here. The world is so filled with such suffering, such misery. The frailty of the human condition exploited by those in power. Im not trying to turn this into a political statement. What Im saying is that darkness has so blanketed our species. If I believed in god, in the devil, in heaven and hell, Id believe the devil had won. My problems, my issues, seem so petty in comparison to the blights of others. But they are no less significant to me. The problems of the world compound the problems in my world. The relationship was simply the straw that broke the camels back, so to speak. She was important to me, but I had learned long ago to not invest too much into anything. I look around me. I see I have friends, family, loved ones. In that respect, I am lucky. But I see none of them. Either by choice or not. I know theyd mourn my passing. But how much more of my torment can my psyche take before I break? How much more of the same meaningless, trivial nonsense can I endure? Statistically is is proven that those in poverty have very little chance of escaping it. Im not saying that money is the end-all, be-all.... but it amounts to a daily struggle I am unsure I am willing to endure for that much longer. I have a gun and a bullet.

"It sounds to me Hyperactive behavior you have a lot on your plate and I understand how difficult that can be. I can also understand feeling Hyperactive behavior you havent accomplished anything yet but you must remember your Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult life has literally only just begun. I didnt have my first job until I was 18 myself. As for the problem with relationships, you need to realize that, even though you were in a relationship with another person who you truly cared for, something some people never get to experience, you still knew what should be expected of the other person in a relationship. I myself suffer from Mental Depression and major clinical Anxiety Mental Depression attacks. The Mental Depression sucks but the Anxiety Mental Depression is worse. When Mental Depression bouts hit me, I only either get Exhaustion and unmotivated or, a few times a year, suicidal. But when the Anxiety Mental Depression attacks I get are common in my weekly life? That can get even worse. My therapist calls it my train, as in train of thought. Ill start with some problem Im having, and in a split second, my mind will follow that train to some highly illogical conclusion. For instance I can be having a problem with my friend. Lets say we have a fight. Well that friend doesnt Hyperactive behavior me anymore -&gt; They will tell all of our mutual friends Im a bad person -&gt; They will realize I am indeed a horrible person -&gt; I wont be able to focus on school because of having to Anxiety about my friends not liking me anymore -&gt; Ill have to drop out of Uni because of bad grades -&gt; I will have to go live with my mom -&gt; Shell kick me out when she sees Im actually just useless -&gt; Ill be homeless -&gt; ill die of starvation or drug overdose in some back-alley.So as you can see, these sorts of ordinary problems a person might experience, my mind warps it into: My friend and I had a fight -&gt; Im going to die homeless in a gutter somewhere. When I got on the right path of being able to tell these bad lines of thought from what was actual logical interjection, it helped me get past a bit of what was happening in my own life. I no longer Anxiety about when the next Anxiety Mental Depression attack is going to come because worrying would sometimes set off the attack in the first place. As for worrying about feeling Hyperactive behavior a drain on your family, please trust me when I say that you can bet that your parents wouldnt have helped pay for school for you if they didnt want you to go. Prove to everyone, but mostly to yourself that you will not be made to play the role of the victim. The problems we face now are only the problems we are facing now. Theres no way to logically know what will hold two or three years down the line. Actively seek out good changes and then they should, I say should because nothing changes how unfair life can be, lead to better things. Self improvement is a great way to negate negative feelings. Dont make yourself better for other people, but make yourself a better person just to show yourself that you can amount to something. Right now you are thinking that you yourself are the worst thing imaginable. Try and separate that part from the main you. Critique simple changes into your life, Hyperactive behavior getting a simple job, doing good in school, building healthy habits and relationships, and set goals for yourself. If I had enough space here Id tell my entire story if only you would listen. Short of it is that I came from nothing. My father was an abusive drunk/drug user who would always beat my mother, my two siblings, and myself. The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 10 years old. I tried to hang myself on the school monkey bars because, on top of the other stuff, I was always bullied at school for my weight. And wouldnt you know it? The shoe lace broke as I jumped because I was too fat to even kill myself for being fat. Now where am I? Im living my dream at the age of 23, studying abroad in Japan working on my degree in History. Still never had a meaningful relationship, but Im working on it through other areas of my life. Still fat, but I dont give a shit what other people think how I should or shouldnt look. If I decide to lose weight, Im going to do so for myself. If I want to become a balerina, I will. Life is about taking the punches, getting back up, and saying, Is that all you got?If you want to talk at all, honestly Im on Reddit almost every minute of the day.

Absolutely no improvement whatsoever in 3 years in anything. This includes guitar, piano, singing, learning how to code (and trying to type faster as a result), working out, lacrosse, playing video games when Im not even good at them, getting good grades at school, trying to learn Korean since Im a Korean-American but kindergartners can speak, write and understand the language at a higher level than me, and nothing. Literally none of those am I even remotely good at. I do not see a single skill that I can perform at a proficient level. And this bothers me as it inhibits my ability to enjoy life. What good am I if I have nothing to contribute?Oh, and by the way, if I recall correctly, that is not the biggest galaxy. I think the name is IC 1101., Thats my only source of happinessI have no hopes or desires in lifeI just want to die as soon as possible, Im 16 right now. I know I may seem too young but this has been my situation for my whole life.Im Exhaustion of pretending to be someone I am not, as I do it every day. I always pretend to be happy when my brain is hell, and for the past 2 years, I couldnt even pretend that well. I broke down, and many people in my school know of my Mental Depression. I just cant find any motivation to try at life. I probably wont even be alive by the end of Drug abuse school, as I think of killing myself every single second., I honestly hate it when people say Oh, other people have it far worse than you so you shouldnt be depressed.What most people do not understand is the Mental Depression is not rational. Comparing ones misery to undervalue others is ignorant. Saying that people cant be sad because others have it worse is Hyperactive behavior saying someone cant be happy because others have it better., I just dont think it will help, and frankly I dont think itll change my mind about life at all. I would rather save my parents money., I try to do that but I cant fully isolate myself. , Ill try it outIt does seem relieving., A few months ago, my sister saw me crying in my room because my Mental Depression was really bad. My mom came home and found me crying and talking to my sister, and my sister explained to her that I was really suicidal. My mom didnt know and at the time, she just told me to stop feeling that way and get better. The exact opposite happened, where my Mental Depression increased exponentially. My mom, however, Forgetfulness it ever happened and started doing the same thing again. Im not close enough to my mom where I can directly tell her, Hey, when you do this, it makes me wanna off myself right now. Instead, I just bottle things in and block her out to the best of my ability., So, my mom compared me for the umpteenth time yesterday and she laughs when she with other people about it and keep mentioning it. I was at my limit yesterday and I got Anger at her and told her to shut up and went to my room. She told my aunt and cousin that I had problems and I need to be fixed. Im sorry mom, I HAVE FUCKING PROBLEMS?!Yeah okay, Ill just fix it by killing myself.Oh my god, I cant wait to Suicide. , Because life is extremely stressful regardlessEven when I dont care and show Indifferent mood to everything, Im still Stress outDeath seems so calming and peaceful to me, No, I cant go anywhere I play league of legends but its kinda pissing me off right now, so my only source of happiness is gone., Its hard to enjoy things in life when you hate life itself. I hate waking in a home where someone else could be living, I hate being fed good food that could go to someone else, I hate everything about being alive.

Its obvious and you start hallucinating after a short while. , You make some excellent points, but how do you know that the person will be happy in the future? The opposite of what you say can be equally as true, as if you actually do succeed in preventing a Suicide, what if that persons life is full of Ache and sorrow? Wouldnt you feel guilty in that situation as well?, Isnt that what Reddit is for? I just vent here every so often because I bottle everything and then I rant here.I heard a lot of people having side effects from medications, and personally I dont want to be happy because I took a pill., I just dont have a Drug abuse chance of committing Suicide right now. Rather than having a failed attempt, I might as well do it later when its basically guaranteed., She wont understand. My sister and I have repeated to her multiple times to stop parenting the way she does. My sister literally said you and dad cant raise kids for shit. Thats why he(me) is so fucked up and wants to die, and had Mental Depression for such a long time.Its not a motivator, it does the complete opposite., No, not at all. I am not close with my dad at all; he was basically a stranger to me all my life, and hes very apathetic and Decreased interest about things so he might just tell me to man up., I used to but now I dont because it didnt really do anything., But when does it get better? Ive been feeling this same way for four years. I dont have any talents or passions in life, so how will things get better for me?, Ive talked to a lot of people. It just keeps getting worse.

"Hi, so last night i was sitting on the ledge of my window contemplating whether or not i should jump. My dad had just choked me and told me that i should get out of the house, and earlier he had called me a bum. To me it seemed as though there was no reason to keep living, the people that are supposed to care about you the most dont. But one thing echoed in my mind, and that was something one of my best friends had told me: you dont help yourself. And reading through your post made me feel like thats also the case for you. Maybe instead of cutting things out, add some things into your life. Go outside, take a deep breath, and talk to somebody new. I dont know your financial situation, but if you can take lessons, join a gym, take classes, the most important thing is you do something for YOU. Be a little selfish, take yourself out to eat in your favorite restaurant once in a while. Try some new food, but do something.

You found me, a random stranger who happened to click on this subreddit and this post the night after he almost committed suicide in order to find help. I realize that its difficult to change the mindset of how it all seems to be hopeless and bleak but theres one thing that i can ask, and thats: do you help yourself? Youre working for a fortune 100 company, but was that what you wanted to do? Do you have hobbies to take your mind off things? Are you taking classes in things that interest you or spending time doing things you enjoy? If not then please start.

I dont know why and i know its very Reflex, Abnormal its just kinda interesting to learn about people.Have you tried commenting on other SuicideWatch threads?The only reason I started talking to you was because I was considering killing myself before my cadet camp. I didnt want to deal with it anymore., How would I know that?Just make your own map of the streets. Hyperactive behavior a street map but homemade. Have you ever read This Boys Life? In the book he Hitch hikes out of the town and then hitch hikes back in the same night. Maybe you could try that? I dunno dude Im just lobbing some ideas your way and your rejecting everything without a second thoughtGive me Something to work with., Hi sorry I havent responded quicklyWhenever i have a shit time I tend to do stuff on my own or without any of the sources of my issues.The reason I took so long to respond is because I went off to a cadet camp. Now Im not saying you have to do something Hyperactive behavior that but i personally believe you have to get into the right mindset to be helped.If that makes any sense?, HeyHave you tried taking a walk at night? Just walk to somewhere and notice how everything looks different. Some people think it looks creepy or eerie compared to day time. I think its entrancing. Now think about your life.

While youre thinking about all this stuff notice how you seem to drift out of connection with whats in front of you.Concentrate on your favourite person in the world.

Im still a teenager and my way of dealing with bullies is get in their face and be prepared to take them on. Prove to everyone that you are a brave person and that you can take everything they give you and maybe dish it back out?Once again I dont know but I guess thats what I would do.",Ideation,Ideation,Indicator
"Thats just it, its not the heroin Im good at, its living the shitty street life of a junkie that I am good at.  Im having such a miserable time trying to adjust to real, sedentary life.  I feel like a constant outsider, and it kills me.I liked the symbol of strength that keeping it gave me for this last year or so, but now that I realized how easy it would be to fill it up with cleaning products its haunting me.  I didnt think about the recognition like that at all though.  I think it just gave me the push I need to stick around at least for another day.  Thank you. , I really appreciate it.  Most of the people I considered friends I need to avoid like the plague due to the habit.  Thanks., Heroin seems like the only option in my mind right now.  Its something I KNOW Im good at, and its the only thing in years thats made me feel anything but depressed.  And it finally dawned on me that I dont have the guts to do anything with a knife or a gun, but I could just as easily poison myself to death with a needle.

"You do that. And hey, even if you dont... like I said before, this kind of things dont ask for your permission anyway, so... it will happen anyway., You are young. Things do get better, you have your whole life ahead of you. You have  plenty of time to find a partner. As for making friends, theres no technique. Just be yourself, open up: a lot of people will appreciate that: online or offline. Having said that, feel free to PM anytime., Well, it happened once, it can happen again. Dont close yourself to new opportunities. Sometimes 30 minutes is all it takes..., You cant show them, theres nothing to show. You can tell them and explain why you see the need to do it, to move out. Explain them this shouldnt affect your friendship. As friends, they should understand your needs, and put them ahead of that need to live all together and party everynight. If they cant see it, its their loss., I know it can be frustrating, and it may take a long time. But, believe me, you need to keep trying, even with no experience youll find something. At least something temporary until you find something better for you.Like I said, you should talk to her. She may be scared of talking about it, she may not know how to approach you about it. You should do it instead, and see what she has to say. , It does sound like a terribly Pain situation to be in. I really cant tell you if that would be the right thing to do or not. It is risky to tell her how you feel right now; yes, it would let her know you are there for her, in case things change; but it could harm your friendship with her and her boyfriend. You know her, you should analize every little possibility before doing it: is she going to feel awkward and maybe stay away?, is she going to tell her boyfriend?, if she does, will he get mad or just stay away from you?. Its up to you to decide, if you are willing to take that risk because not saying anything hurts more, then go for it. Whatever choice you make, make sure its in your best interest... whatever will be better for you in the long run, what will be easier for you to cope with., I bet its terribly hard to even think about it. And its also hard to put ourselves before other people too. Specially if you invested almost 5 years of your life in the relationship. But you need to be thinking of whats best for you. If you have more time and less worries on your head youll be able to focus on getting a job, and a place to stay. Just, take care of yourself. This will also be important for you to have a better relationship. If not with her, then with someone else; but the key is to feel good about yourself and who you are before anything else., You probably wont care for a while. It happens to all of us. But this kind of things dont ask for your permission, they just happen. You are young, youll find someone else, and if not, someone else will find you. Relationships are crazy like that, when one ends we lose faith in them, but then another one starts. Youll be ok, and if you get your life in order, and feel good about who you are, youll find someone that fits perfectly into your new life... it takes time, but it just... suddenly happens., Do you have any idea of what made you feel Depression in the 1st place?, Well, thats what Id need to know to tell you what Id do! haha, but here are 2 options: If we had a really good relationship, and I really cared about him, I would keep it to myself. But of course I would explain what the situation is, not to give any false hopes. My hopes would be to preserve that friendship intact (Im assuming the relationship with her boyfriend is pretty solid tho, I dont know if it actually is). The other option, (and again, this would depend on the kind of relationship you 2 have), would be to push him away a lil bit. Not out of majot bitchiness, but avoid hurting him or having him in situations where he might fell bad. Now, both of these can have different results... I guess it depends on whether they are one of those couple that share eeeeverything with each other or not., It does look like you have to get out of that enviroment. What are your plans for next year when you turn 18?, Same for you! Good luck!, Well I wouldnt expect you to want to right now. You still need to figure out what to do with your current relationship. All Im saying is, once you make a decision: keep an open mind. Thats the wonderful thing of love at 1st sight, it just... happens. Love is also something to look forward too, just stay positive and look at all the things that are yet to come., Well, as a girl I dont really know where you can meet girls. But I can tell you I did meet my boyfriend online (and not in a dating site either, just... social network, just got a message from a random stranger and we started talking about random things). I find it to be a good way of meeting people: it can go one of 2 ways: you can find people that lie; or people that will be absolutely honest because they have nothing to prove to you.I know being alone can be tough, and in your case, having someone so close to you that you want, but seems so unreachable at the same time. I dont think you can go out looking for love, but, just put yourself out there, and it eventually finds you. Sometimes it takes a while, of course, but when it comes it will be worth it.I know I probably didnt help much, just wanted to tell you not to give up, love just has a way of appearing when you least expect it., For what I read your friends seem to be acting kinda childish. It shouldnt be that big of a deal, nor should affect your friendship in such a way. Id tell you to count your blessings more than your losses... You have a great girl, and the opportunity to find a better place that suits your needs. If they arent willing to accept that moving out is not some kinda of betrayal, then it doesnt seem to be a real friendship, you know, at least from their point of view. I understand your feelings towards them might be sincere, but friendships cant be one-sided. Try to work things out, but all in all, its up to them to see that they are making a huge drama-fest out of something thats not that bad., In my opinion, the first need thing you should try, is to not feel ashamed. You did nothing wrong, what you did, you did out of love. You are not the one who should be ashamed. Its the person who you trusted that should be. We all have failed relationships, and the feelings that you have: feeling used, worthless; are pretty much on the normal side. But you need to talk about it to overcome those feelings. With anyone. You should try your parents, after all, you already came out to them; and what happened to you, happens to a lot of people, and it hurts the same way to everyone of them. Being conservative shouldnt prevent them from understanding what you are going through. If you still dont feel confortable with them, you always have a bunch of strangers right here that are willing to listen to you., You are welcome. I know it sucks, but you REALLY didnt do ANYTHING, that would make them act like that; be sure you are not the problem here, they are. Hopefully theyll understand that at some point., Id say you give her the chance to tell you how she feels. Then again, for what Ive read, your relationship may not be at its best right now. Just see what she has to say, Im sure youll be able to figure out what to do after that. If you dont think shell be part of the solution, she is probably part of the problem. And I know its hard to hear, but if shes not gonna help you out, you need to move on and focus on yourself., Same here, you can PM if you want., You can PM me if you like., Well Im a lil older than you, and we cant exactly hang out. But you can PM me if you wanna talk., Well, you have been capable of establishing a meaningful relationship before, so be sure you can do it again. Also, Im assuming you just finished high school or are about to, youll meet lots of new people from here on. Dont be scared to  open up to new people: you did it already, you can do it again!, Feeling like you owe people for things in your life shouldnt make you feel trapped, but grateful. Remember when people do things for you, its because they care, not because they expect something in return. If your family didnt want you around, they wouldnt notice the absence so much; if they do, theyd probably like to have you around. Id recommend you to drop them a line, let them know how you are feeling; if they know, theyll be able to show their support.Dont think you are not good enough, you dont have to live by anyone standards but yours. Make clear whats important to you, and stay true to that. , You are young. Its hard to go out and finally get out lives started. Be patient, and stay focused. Im trying to get a job too, and its difficult (different country tho), but you just need to keep trying, perseverance will bring results eventually. Probably once that happens, you will start feeling better about yourself, and that will definitely help to make relationships with the people around you better. Talk to your girlfriend, you feeling like this is probably affecting her and the way she acts around you too. I dont know how I would act if I found my boyfriend with a gun in his hand either. Tell her how you feel, and ask her to help you stay motivated to do all the things you wanna do. Im sure you can make it.",Supportive,Supportive,Supportive
"I understand the logic of waiting till you have the resources. Its what I tell myself as well. But I wonder, living this kind of destructive life, will we ever have those resources before we get out? Your mom, mine, corrodes every little bit of good you manage to build up. For every hour your therapist gets to build you up she gets 50 to tear you down. The money and job, will you be able to get something good enough anyway while youre stewing in misery? You could just walk away, live out of a car and flip burgers until you found what youre looking for. Seems much less comfortable but it might also be much less likely to make you want to kill yourself. I spend so much time telling myself I just need to get things in order so that I wont fail when I finally try but I wonder if thats just a way of procrastinating and keeping myself from doing what I fear. I wonder if eventually we just have to jump without a parachute anyway. , Thats the kind of insight that it seems a lot of people never obtain in a lifetime. I watch so many people grind away in Depressed mood lives and never question any of it. They roll their eyes at their own fantasies of a different life and use cliches Hyperactive behavior thats life and everyone hates their job to justify not taking the risk of letting go of the devil they know. So if running off to the forest offered even a possibility of more happiness, youd be a fool not to chase it. Maybe its everything you hope it will be, maybe it Nausea off into something better, maybe it just ends up being a needed break and you come back feeling better. I really dont see how it could go wrong given how you feel now. No one chases real happiness anymore, they all drank the koolaid, its unfortunate.As far as how, I dont know as much about it as I wish I did. I know that a lot of state and federal parks provide lodging for their employees to live on site. I once met someone that did that, just traveled the country doing ranger work in places Hyperactive behavior Yellowstone and Yosemite. Also maybe the subs Hyperactive behavior /r/homestead /r/Homesteading and /r/SelfSufficiency might be good for some ideas. Or /r/TinyHouses and drag one off to a secluded RV park. And not that its very foresty, but it is out there and lends itself to living on your own... I heard someone on a podcast talking about doing the same thing and going to live by the Salton sea because land is in the 4 digits. So theres lots of options and most of them are probably easier than the corporate life in many ways.But you dont sound Hyperactive behavior youre doing very good *today*. Whichever way you might go, it may be that none of it can be put into action quickly enough to give you the relief you need this week. So in the Irritable Mood time, maybe a therapist with an immediate opening could help blow off enough steam to keep going a little longer and have time to work on this stuff? And if I can help, drop me a pm., Well, statistically speaking, I can tell you that odds are not in your favor for being able to keep yourself from acting on both the pedophilia nor the suicidal inclination. People dont just white knuckle these sorts of things and get better on their own. Having insurance puts you ahead of most, it would be unfortunate if you didnt take advantage of it. The fears you have are real, but Ventricular Dysfunction, Left untreated theres going to come a time when you find the outcome to be far worse than the risks you describe here and wish you could turn back time to redo it. Without help, youre going to end up damning your future kids to living the same life youve lived, either by having been abused or by having a father who killed himself, the psychological toll for them will be mostly the same. You can go to war now with whatever dark thing created this mess, or you can let it run its course and the Ache you feel now will echo for generations to come. Either way you have a monumental step to take. People generally choose the later because inaction seems easier, but the cost ends up being so much higher., Maybe the antidepressants arent working as well as youre giving them credit for. Wouldnt it be nice if you got a little better mix and got to enjoy the things you have in your life? It sounds Hyperactive behavior you have the elements of a happy life, thats half the fight, further than a lot of us get. The second half is being able to feel the happiness from them. That takes more work and time, but it would be a shame to get this close and give up., I was badly suicidal for a long time, I still might be, Im not quite sure right now. The thing that bewildered me about it was that the people that knew how close to dying I was, would over and over again let me walk out of the room when I could have very well been going off to kill myself. Some just didnt care, the rest... I get that its a hard subject for them. What do I say? What can I do? Is it any of my business? It would be too awkward. Im sure itll be ok anyway And they would play russian roulette by leaving me alone and I would go sit under a noose and wonder why they cared so little that theyd rather let me die than help. So having seen it from that side, I think that if the roles were ever reversed and I thought someone I loved was at risk of dying, I would move heaven and earth to help them, right now. Id put my whole life on hold, handcuff myself to them figuratively, maybe literally, call everyone that could possibly help. Because nothing could be worse than saying well try tomorrow and then finding her dead tomorrow.But, you know, my situation probably resulted in that overkill mentality. As it is, if youre in college there are counselors for this, a lot of students get Depressed mood and suicidal. There are community mentally health organizations (not my favorite option), hospitals with psych units (probably not her favorite option, but 72 hours inpatient and doctors that can pull out the big guns might be what it takes. You could plead to her parents, its not Hyperactive behavior they could have any more disdain anyway and it might scare them into action. And if nothing else just do things to keep her mind off it until you can get more help. Because sitting and stewing in your Mental Depression is how you go from looking up things online to actually doing it. I hope it gets better for you guys., I find myself conflicted about giving this advice, but if I can help you, I can help your family. So as for your fears of being reported. Find someone you Hyperactive behavior and can talk to about the anxiety, Mental Depression and Suicide. Then when you can trust them and get a feel for how they think, send an anonymous letter from a PO box or an email saying that you would Hyperactive behavior to become a client and receive counseling for the pedophilia but explain your worries and ask for their policy. Its possible they could lie just to get you to come forward but thats why you get to know them first with the Mental Depression help. If their policy eases your fears, then you can come forward in your next meeting and tell them it was you who sent the email., Try to remember that being surrounded by horrible people can warp your perception of the future and make you belive things you otherwise wouldnt. Theyre shoveling crap onto a pile faster than you can dig yourself out of it. In a few months you could take yourself away from it and have none of that negative input. Your feelings about life and the future could literally change overnight, or at least very quickly. I think it would be a shame not to get to try that, as long as you can clench your teeth and get through the next 3 months, I used to know that person. It was a surreal feeling to feel that someone else in your head was out to get you. I felt that I was my conscious mind, and my sub conscious mind was an entity of its own that hated me. I used to plead with him just give me a break today and you can make the next 7 Chest Pain all you want. He always ignored me. Im not completely better now by any means, but I am just enough that I dont feel Hyperactive behavior that anymore. Ive spent so much time analyzing it too that it starts to make better sense. Youve been Chest Pain and damaged by the people around you for so long that everything is a mess, and the mind needs to find a cause for the damage, something has to be to blame. But the people that did the damage have trained you with bad self esteem to not blame them. And even if you try to blame yourself it doesnt quite fit because on some level you know you wouldnt do this to yourself. But theres no where else to point the finger, and your bad self esteem also makes you want to blame yourself anyway, so you split yourself and blame him. Hes not real, hes just a defense mechanism to try to explain the pain.As far as being diagnosed and told youll have to learn to live with something. I think thats a cop out that some people Hyperactive behavior to use because they dont see the long view. Theres no reason to have to learn to live with any of this stuff, Hyperactive behavior I said it the other post, you werent born broken, anything thats broken now can be fixed given enough time and effort. Its not easy, but its not permanent, you were trained to be Hyperactive behavior this, you can untrain yourself with some help. Getting a therapist to be a voice of reason can help a lot. Once you find the right one, you can have someone there to say all of the helpful things that should have been said all along but werent. A Depressed mood mind cant fix itself by itself, its been stepped on for so long that it only knows one way of thinking, which is why Suicide ends up looking Hyperactive behavior such a good answer., The lack of intimacy is the part that makes you think divorce is looming but not the gun thing? Youve been sober 2 years and married just over 2, so you met and married while you were still in your addiction, was he as well? Is he still? How can you hope to get better if at best youre still surrounded by damaging things or at worst, surrounded by THE damaging things that caused it. The fact that youve stayed sober through it is extraordinary. Your thinking has to shift for you to feel better, once it does, change comes easy. The fine print of course is that shifting your thinking is one of the most difficult things a person can do, doubly so when its still tied to the things that created it. You need a sponsor, they are infinitely more insightful in dealing with these problems than we can be and it gives you someone to act as a solid, trustworthy base point that it sounds Hyperactive behavior you need. As a bonus, working the 12 steps is a good way to be able to lessen the temptation to drink and really heal rather than just white knuckle it. Groups would also be great people to build a friend base out of and depending on where you live you can find one happening almost every day. You could go tonight, and they would be delighted if you showed up and asked for help in your time of need. Good luck, I hope things start to get better for you., &gt;in a thread where a mans life and livelihood is at stake. Other than charge into this thread with profanity and insults, I seem to have missed where you gave a single helpful suggestion to the OP. You must be working on that reply now though, Im sure in all of your eloquent glory., My story was much of the same. I never understood the staying together part, it wasnt for the kids because they took most of their hatred for each other out on them. Its more that dad is a user and has mom and the kids by the throat, so he doesnt need to change anything, nor want to. Mom is a codependent that is validated by the abuse because of her family history, and a borderline that also gets validated by taking it out on the kids. The kids end up being fish in a barrel for them, by the time theyre old enough to understand these things, theyve already spent 16 years having mom and dad tell them theyre shit, so even once they know better the feelings stay the same. No ones self esteem survives that and Mental Depression is inevitable. Of the many kids in my family, all of them are broken and half are suicidal. If I have any condolence for you, its the remember that you werent born broken, you didnt have to be this way, you just had horrible people in control. If you can get away from them, after a while of not having them shoveling more crap on the pile, your mentality will change. Living with them is why it seems so futile. For every hour of work you do with a therapist or on your own, they get 23 to tear you back down. Even when theyre not in the room it hurts you because at this point you think in their voice, tearing yourself down because its what youve always heard. If you could get a few years of distance from it, that voice would fade. Its not easy of course, going out on your own while being broken, but then getting to Suicide isnt easy either. I hope you can give yourself a little more time to try to save it., I think a lot of suicidal people would give anything to have the sort of parents you described. Wed be able to go to them, tell them we were absolutely about to give up, and have them take over and help us Hyperactive behavior rational loving people can. Have you tried that? I think it would be a shame to leave without at least giving them that chance., The fact that this hurts you so much means that youll be the kind of parent that the world desperately needs more of. It would be sad to lose one of the few we have.Im on the adoption bandwagon. I always felt that adopted children are a little luckier than others. You end up knowing for certain that your parents wanted you so much that they went out looking for you. That they jumped through all kinds of legal hoops and paperwork to make sure they could have you and you werent just an accident or a midlife pressure decision.Also, and I know this isnt any help when youre feeling bad, but 25 is young too. Im 29 and feel bad about being alone but I still dont think I would have kids now if I could. Id rather wait till 35 and be sure my mental cement is all dried first so that I can do a good job and give them the happiness I missed out on., Depression is sort of the absence of hope. I think most people run on a lot of hope without realizing it. A little bit of hope for something on the weekend, looking forward to a paycheck, knowing they will get some enjoyment at work tomorrow, planning what they are going to do after work, looking forward to seeing a loved one or working on a hobby. Normal people are fueled by dreams of the future. For Depressed mood people that all dries up. Today Chest Pain, yesterday Chest Pain, the day before that Chest Pain... I dont have any hope that tomorrow will feel good. The weekend will feel the same as the weekdays, all of the little nice things that happen along the way wont be enough for me to feel anything about them. Everything turns to grey and with that comes profound sadness. Its Hyperactive behavior walking down a road too foggy to see in front of yourself, youre pretty sure there isnt anything ahead either, its just you, standing in the fog hurting. And you keep going because everyone says you have to, so you go another month and find that its still you standing in the fog and hurting, a little further down the road. You know whats going to happen next month now, you cant hope for anything different.If I could give one piece of advice to someone worrying they might be Depressed mood, its Dont wait. Throw everything you can at it as hard as you can and as soon as you can. Therapists, medication, exercise, meditation, forcing yourself to do things, everything. Its Hyperactive behavior a cancer that just gets worse the longer you stew in it until youre so broken that you cant be put back together at all.",Indicator,Indicator,Indicator
"I feel extremely Suicidal pretty much all the time, I know how it is.I started talking to a certain person about it, seeking help (not a therapist).

I know exactly how you feel, and it completely fucking sucks that its always there, and youre always thinking about and wanting to do it.Id suggest the elastic band/tight hair band thing - snapping it on my arms always helps (but careful not to do it too hard and too much in one place, as it leaves these marks that can stay there for well over a day). The only problem is that the Pain is short lived. Like, cuts are Pain when you cut, and then for quite a while afterwards, but Pain from the rubber bands/hair bands fades too quickly, so you have to do it more often. , Why is that? Im not doubting you or your judgement, but I would like to hear more, Id like to know why you feel this is the case., Im really sorry to hear youve lost family members and had all of these problems. Its really easy for this stuff to stack up and get on top of you, so its important that youre able to talk about it to deal with it all. Its awful that youve lost the person who has helped you through so much, it really is, but it isnt the end. You can deal with this stuff, suicide isnt your only option.Firstly, is there anyone else you can turn to? I ask, because obviously, finding a new confidante would be a great way to help you get back on track. Now, if you dont think theres anyone you can turn to, have you considered seeking professional help? It gets suggested often because it really does help to have someone just listen to you, and give input when you need it. Therapists can help guide you through your problems in a way that sometimes even close friends cant.It may also help to bring something new into your life, to focus yourself on. Its not going to solve anything, but it will really help take your mind off of things so that it doesnt seem so much., Yes, I definitely prefer to do it slow, even if emotionally Im a wreck at the time, going slow is always better. Im always wary of depth, especially since I used to cut mostly on the insides of my thighs, because I dont want to knick a vein or artery; suicide isnt my goal.I cut deeper than I used to, but thats because with experience has come a greater awareness of the maximum depth I should cut to. I dont want excessive Bleeding, because anything that might create too high of a risk of Infection or become problematic in some other way would mean going to the doctors/hospital - something I must avoid at all costs., See, the reason threads like this dont get much attention is because it feels impersonal, like youre just saying Im the problem solver! Let me solve all the problems!.If you really want to help, then try and make sure nobody is left hanging; nobody on here should go unanswered. If you read someones post, and feel like you can help, then absolutely go for it. Your effort is admirable, it really is, but this probably isnt the best way for you to help out., You deserve a lot better than the lot youve got, but I promise that if you just hang in there, things are going to look up for you.I know others have said their inboxs are open if you need to talk, and obviously you can post here whenever you need help/advice, but just PM if you feel you need to, Im always listening., Were not here to judge, or to tell you to stop. I know how it helps to make you feel, but just make sure you take care of yourself. If you do want to try and stop, then places like /r/StopSelfHarm and /r/depression can be excellent resources and communities. Its always easier to stop anything when you have support from others. , OP, have you considered that a lot of us dont want to stop? That it works for us? That were safe?Ive been raised inside a family filled with nurses, so safety has been drilled into me since... ever. Im careful not to cut where there may be exposed arteries, and I clean every single wound - if it causes too much Bleeding or gets infected, that means a trip to the hospital and unwanted exposure, so Id bet the vast majority of us are safe.And fyi, self-harm is suicide prevention., Ill reply all night if you want me to. You deserve a life, a good one, and if you hang in there, you can have one., &gt; and water Common cold water, not warm. Definitely do not use warm water to clean out the blood. , &gt; heart basically stopped.I know that feeling.You think someone is about to discover your SH, and your stomach just drops and this pit opens up inside you. Its the fucking worst feeling., Yeah, Im kinda confused as to why s/he chose to restrict this to one country...., Shame usually led me to.throw them away, but Id usually use them a few times. I keep the last blades I used symbolically - but if I relapse then yup, frenzy of trying to pull the blades off my razor again. I almost relapsed a month ago - closest Id been since stopping - after I was robbed and had all my valuables stolen, and the only thing that stopped by was that I couldnt get the damn blade off my razor. Gave me time to calm down a bit, and think about what I was about to do. , Ive been in the situation where someone who was suicidal, who I was talking to, had been making really big improvements in his life and taking some really positive steps, suddenly regressed and set a date for his suicide. I became extremely concerned, and there was nothing I could do to sway him. I tried to subtlety gather information so I could get him help. He needed it, and I couldnt do anything more via skype. He stopped talking to me before I could gather enough info to do anything, but it was before the date he set to kill himself.When its a choice between someone dying, and getting someone into a place where they cant Pain themselves and could potentially get the help they need - most of us will choose the latter. Im sorry that it was a horrible experience, but you cannot expect people to stand aside and let you die. Obtaining permission to contact people is ideal, but sometimes its not possible without endangering your efforts to stop them killing themselves. , Its because of my level of awareness that I feel comfortable using it as a coping mechanism.When Ive considered suicide, usually at the peak of Emotional upset distress, Ive made myself calm down and think Is this the logical decision?, as in, is this absolutely the right decision that has been thought through, or am I experiencing heightened Emotional upset Pressure? Its the same kind of thing with cutting. I know many people here feel it controls them, but I most certainly dont. Im making a conscious choice, in the same way I do if I decide not to eat for a day or decide not to leave my bed for however long etc. It isnt my sole coping mechanism, its one of many. I can, and do, control myself. I know what can happen, but I also know what happens when I lose control; I close in on suicide again. I will not always be able to stop myself, and these coping mechanisms help prevent me from reaching a mental state where I have to.And I promise you; nobody is affected other than me., I just use razor blades, and cut my thighs. I normally only do two or three cuts at one time, although sometimes it may be double that (three on each thigh, for example). I guess its the most common method because its the easiest. I have a ton of razor blades for shaving anyway., Its not weakness; you opened yourself up to someone, gave yourself to them - that takes more bravery than a lot of people can muster. Unfortunately, it hasnt worked out for you as you planned.But I really hope that you come to realise that this is so far from the end... The Pain fades, albeit after much Emotional upset Pain and longing for what you thought could have been, but it does fade. Im not telling you to let go, but I do believe wholeheartedly that youll find your way back from the wilderness youre in because of what youre going through. Hang in there, yeah?, Okay, calm down, take a deep breath, and lets think about this.Are you sure theres no place for you to go? Nobody you can stay with for just a while? Youre not alone, youre reaching out for help, and there are always people online who will help if they can. If you really cant find anywhere to stay, Id suggest going to /r/askreddit(/r/askreddit) or something similar, as theyll either help you directly or point you in the direction of a subreddit that can.This is a temporary situation, and we cant let them get the best of us. Try to remain calm and collect yourself, because youre going to have to keep focused to get past this tough time, but you will if you reach out, which youre doing., Im always a bit fearful about my blades being discovered :/ But your boyfriend sounds pretty great about it, so take solace in that at the Tired least?, In the UK you literally cant buy enough ibuprofen or paracetamol to overdose on from any one place. Youd have to go to more than one shop, and even then, theyre all individually wrapped so it would take ages to try and overdose. , Ive been guilty of giving advice on cleaning wounds, so I apologise. I base it on my experience, and coming from a nursing family, where I kind of just know how to treat minor wounds and ailments because I was raised that way - its like common sense for me, but youre absolutely right, it Falls under giving medical advice. , No... I dont think thats a fair comment to make. The people most likely to respond to your post are the ones who think the same as you.I wasnt going to respond, but I saw this comment and felt obliged to point out that I certainly dont hate people, and I dont gate being touched, and I enjoy the company of others more than anything in the world., That is not even remotely similar. , Asking for help is failing; its bravery.Often, the hardest thing we can bring ourselves to do is admit that we cant cope, that things are too much, and that we need help. And its brave. Youre brave.Im really sorry that your mother was abusive, that must have been horrible. My parents also got divorced (when I was 7), and although my father wasnt really abusive, he did hate me whilst simultaneously adoring my brothers. Im telling you this because I want you to know that youre not alone, and that feeling of Numbness can be brought on by so many things, and there isnt any one way to deal with it.But taking your own life isnt the solution. You may not be able to think of a reason why you want to live right now, but that doesnt mean there isnt one. It sounds to me like you need to talk, to feel again. If youre able, a professional to listen to you is just about the most liberating experience, and it could really help you reconnect with the world. Youll have an outlet for that anger, and someone who really will listen to you, and remember that nothing you say is pathetic, it means something to you, so it means something, and its important.I cant really suggest any particular outlets other than finding something for you to focus on. It could be something as simple as a sport or hobby, but could also be helping out at a charity or other type of project. Anything that gives you some direction and focus will help you see that theres so much to live for, and so much to look forward to. , Lifelong Eczema sufferer here; cocoa butter cream is what youre looking for OP.To date, no other cream has soothed Itching as much as cocoa butter. It has the added benefit of helping to make scars fade if applied over longer periods of time. If youve already itched a lot and it has become inflamed, then you want to take cetirizine antihistamines (just one).NOTE: Ask at the chemist to double check with the antihistamines. Im giving you this advice based on 22 years of medical history solving chronic Itching. , This is my feelings exactly. This might sound harsh, but the posts soliciting PMs and Im here to help!! always seems a little superficial to me :/ And highly ineffective. I absolutely hate seeing posts unanswered, because having been there myself, to put yourself on the line and be ignored... its shattering... It should always be a priority to make sure nobody goes unanswered, so that they know theyre heard at the Tired least., I think thats up to you. When I get to my absolute limit, and feel ike Im going to snap and break my clean streak, I snap the rubber band on my wrist until I calm down. I still consider myself clean, because Im not cutting, and for me thats the goal. , &gt; In my state its perfectly legal to shoot and kill someone to prevent an imminent rape of oneself or a third partyAnd in my country, thats illegal. In fact, if you were shot by a civilian whilst committing a crime, youd have a feasible case to sue them. Above and beyond every arbitrary law, there are human rights, rights we all have access to at all times, the most fundamental of which being the right to life., I know you probably know this - but its people thinking they can apply the it gets better to depressed/self harming/suicidal people. Its been covered a lot in /r/SuicideWatch. But that campaign specifically pertains to LGBT people, and LGBT specific issues. , At 14, I had a similar problem. My circumstances were different in that self-loathing about my sexuality led to self-destructive behaviour and attitude, but I was in the same rut youre in now.How your life looks at 14 doesnt reflect the outstanding person youre going to become. Youre going to find your calling in life, whether in 2 years or 10, and from that youll make your own way totally independent of your siblings; people will stop comparing you to them because youll be your own person with your own life. Youre going to have new experiences and meet tons of new people, and youre going to hate some of them, but youre also gonna hit it off with others, because thats just how it works. Things might look shitty now, because you have the unfortunate luck of being stuck in a place where people dont appreciate you for who *you* are; for that Im truly sorry, but you know what? Youre gonna climb out of that dump and youre gonna start finding out who you are, and meet others who do love and appreciate you no matter what.What youre going through now is awful, and it may seem like its going to go on forever - but all of this is going to end, and youre going to be awesome. So frickin awesome. , Always clean them. Always. If you dont then you risk infection, which means Tired bad trip to the doctors or worse - the hospital.I used stuff called TCP, a fantastic multipurpose antiseptic. You can apply it with toilet paper, but its much better to apply it with specialised medical gauze. If youre looking to not raise suspicion from people you live with, then just use elastoplasts (also known as band-aids) to cover the wounds once youve cleaned them thoroughly. , Hey, I dont know what has lead you to this, but would you mind talking about it? Whats happening in your life to make you feel like this is the only option?, Starvation isnt self harm, starvation would be more akin to attempted suicide. Self harm prevents us from doing anything worse; cuts, burns, Contusion - they mean we dont kill ourselves, and were able to cope. Starvation is a direct threat to your life. If youre feeling like you need to starve yourself, then please see a therapist/councillor or doctor. , Hey, lets talk about this. Whats on your mind?, Well if you feel that his work is a visual representation of what youre going through, then Id imagine it would terrify you, as I know it would me. Think of it like The Picture of Dorian Gray. , Well, I dont really find that to be an issue..., Dude. **Rule number 1** for SH is *always* keep your wounds clean. *Always*. Infections means questions. Always have a bottle of TCP to treat wounds afterwards, including burns (though sudocrem would be better suited to burns)., First off, hi. Youre absolutely right that writing it out helps, because it lets you take everything thats swirling around in your head and arrange it cohesively, where its easier to understand. Reading your first paragraph was like reading some of the things Ive written myself before; when Im feeling particularly... down... I write down what Im feeling. Everything. All of it. So you writing this out is a great start, Id say.Try not to think so much about what others will think about you; the most important thing is what you think of you. We dont always like what we see, because were overly critical of ourselves, but also often blinded by negative emotion. Try not to doubt yourself so much; I know, easier said than done right? But thats probably where youre going to have to start, because until you see that youre an intelligent, beautiful, loving person, then youll struggle to realise your ambitions. You feel like theres no job prospects for you, and I dont know what youre field is or what jobs you hope to get, but as someone in a field of slim chances, I can tell you not to let that get to you. You got into your field for a reason, now let that reason guide your ambition.Things are going to get better for you, because youve hit a low, so the only place you can go is up, and you most certainly will if you give yourself the chance., I wish I could help. I was always afraid my last boyfriend would see my scars (also mostly on my thighs), but I managed to keep them secret.If youre super uncomfortable with people seeing them when theyre exposed and commenting, then tell them first? Lie, if you have to, and say theyre from something else - either way, it would stop unwanted questions. I know from past experience that I just cannot deal with questions., Thanks. I always downvote them because it makes me feel uncomfortable to have them here, like there are people reading through our posts to pry and study us like test subjects. , Hey, I just wanted to link you to this:http://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/wiki/index#wiki_how_do_i_care_for_burns.3FIts from the wiki, and it will give you accurate advice for treating burns. Always remember to treat your wounds; if can seriously impact your health not to, and trips to the doctors or hospital for not treating it could mean sudden exposure to friends and family about your SH. , If you love them, and they love you, then thats a great start :)What exactly is making you feel like you need to end your life?, Then maybe find something outside of your norm, something new to invest yourself in? Finding self-worth isnt always easy, but finding something that gives meaning to your life can be a great thing. You have art; thats absolutely brilliant! Art is an amazing medium of expression, so expand into that area - visit art galleries, talk with other artists on reddit and in real life, look for community art societies and projects.I have to apologise here, but its 2am, and I really cant stay up any longer tonight, but PM me and we can keep talking tomorrow, okay?, I think its a perfectly acceptable coping mechanism so long as, as you stated, youre controlling it. As a means of dealing with overly strong emotions/experiences, it beats out pretty much everything else; its easier, quick, and doesnt have many adverse affects - as long as you can keep control. Controlled self-injury means, for me, a life without excessive Stress and a life where I can deal with all the shit I have on my plate. Its worked for 2 years, and Ill probably need it for a few years more, but I know that I can stop if I need to, Im careful when I cut (and obviously always clean the cuts... if it gets infected then Id have to go to the doctors and explain it), and although Im not ashamed per se, I do find that its best not to tell other because they may not understand it.It will be seen by others in the light of loss of control and total inability to deal with things, when I feel its quite the opposite. So yeah, as long as youre in control, keep doing it, but if you feel like its taking over, like its an addiction or always your first port of call whilst the cuts get deeper and deeper and more frequent, then maybe its time to scale things back., Our futures often turn out differently to how we imagined, but thats alright.Dont feel like you need to rush anything, because Emotional upset Pain can last for a long time - do things in your own time frame. Just try to deal with your emotions, and not dwell too much on what could have been, youll be okay :), I know what you mean. And it can come on just all of a sudden. I try to not be a pushy anti-SH person, but Im doing pretty well not cutting (not cut since February), and hope my titbits can help others, maybe. But yeah, evenings are the worst for me. I really struggle some nights, and end up needing my elastic band.... a lot. , I think this is better placed in /r/StopSelfHarm(/r/StopSelfHarm)?Its just that not all of us want to stop or have any intention of stopping., I dont want you to die.When you look at life through shit stained glass, then sure, its gonna look shit, but life can and will get better for you. Youre at university yeah? Well, I can speak from experience when I say Societies are a great way to find a new direction or purpose, and certainly a great way to meet new people and friends. What do you enjoy? Because theres something for everything, thats the great thing about university.As a gay guy, I can empathise with the position youre in with your mother. You say she would be destroyed, but shes your mother, and chances are, shell still love you. If she doesnt, and/or you are rejected by the rest of your family, then I can tell you that this isnt the end of the world, and you can move forwards.And thats what I think you need most, a direction in life. I cant tell you what to do, but I can tell you that finding yourself a new purpose is something that can be really life changing. If you cant find something through university, look around your local community, is there a project or program that you think you could take part in? Its gonna require you to be more proactive, but I promise you it will give you a new gusto and really help you find where to go.Please dont kill yourself, youre my age, you have a long life ahead of you that will get better. I cant promise its always going to be easy, or that its going to get better overnight, but things are going to look up, and when they do, itll be all the sweeter because of what youve been though., &gt; I feel more like it gives me a sense of relief when I feel upset, or angry.Thats exactly how it helps me, but I still feel like Im doing it, I could choose not to if I wanted, but I chose to do it because of the relief it brings., No it absolutely is not a form of self harm. Im extremely disturbed that you think it is, extremely. Self harm is suicide prevention. Of coping. Take your horrible pro-suicide views to /r/suicideology where they belong, they are NOT welcome here., Definitely. Youre weary, and emotionally at your most vulnerable when youre on youre own at night. Your guard is down, youve let loose, and with that comes everything... usually the negative. OP, it helps to try and be around people you love and trust when it feels like too much. You dont need to tell them how you feel or anything; just being around those kinds of people honestly helps. , And thats great that he seems somewhat understanding... like you say, most people havent got a clue, and attach so much stigma and make it such a taboo... to have someone close not judge you is great :), It might seem like your family hates you on the surface, but they love you, and Im certain theyd hate to see you self-loathing and hurting yourself through alcoholism. They dont hate you, theyre concerned about you, because like most families, they only want whats best for you, and seeing you Pain yourself will be upsetting to them. First things first, you need to deal with your alcoholism. Youre not going to be able to get things back on track whilst your struggling with a crippling addiction. Im no expert, but recognising that you have a problem is a great start, and you should seriously consider seeking further support in your local area (or if youre not comfortable seeking it in your local area, then somewhere outside it thats still accessible).Higher eduction isnt everyones calling; thats nothing to be ashamed of. My younger brother failed to get into university, but that wasnt the end of the road, because theres always so many other opportunities out there. Please dont give up, your family can be a great support network, and even if theyre negative towards your failings, theyll be overwhelmingly positive when you do succeed - and you will., The other two responses have given far more than I could, but I just wanted to say that I know what its like writing that note, and how therapeutic I found it. Writing it out, or recording/videoing a goodbye, even when never intended for actual usage, can be so therapeutic. This isnt going to be the case for everyone, obviously, but reading what you wrote, it sounds like you needed to to make some of these pent up feelings feel.... real.I dont know if Im explaining myself, but if you found writing the note helpful, just try recording yourself speaking about how you feel. You dont have to listen to it back, or ever share it, and you can even delete it, but if youre anything like me then it might just help you make your thoughts and feelings more clear., Cutting yourself is self destructive, I used to do that. Hanging yourself, taking a pill overdose, or slashing your wrists open is absolutely fucking not the same as eating a fucking burger. Or even similar to unhealthy coping mechanisms like cutting, or over eating. I dont claim we should do something when people Pain themselves. I never fucking said that so back the fuck off.I said when people try to kill themselves we intervene. Youre absolutely fucking disgusting if you want to support people killing themselves and I will not only report you to the mods for breaking sub rules but you should be reported irl for facilitating suicide. Whereas Id be trying to coax someone off the edge of a bridge, youd be screaming at me for doing so, and demanding that I let them jump. Fucking disgusting. , Ive been in your situation, and it was pretty fucking hard for me to do it - but I kind of just blurted it out (and then felt light headed because she was the first person Id ever told and freaked out a bit just telling her). We were talking about coping mechanisms, and she asked me about what coping strategies Ive consciously used, and I just went for it and told her. I say I just went for it, but it took me a good 6/7 weeks between deciding I was going to tell her, and actually doing it, but it was worth it, because then she helped me deal with it, find better, positive coping strategies that ultimately helped me stop (1 year last month without cutting). So my only advice to you would be to just bring it up. I kind of took my therapist aback, since she didnt see it coming at all (shed asked if I SHd or used any substances in like our earliest sessions over a year ago at that point). But its relevant, and the only way your therapist can help you is if you tell her. Its hard, believe me I know, but to quote some lyrics: Suck it and bite the bullet., I remember that feeling; its weird how it feels good, isnt it? Conflicted good.Be careful, because once you start going deeper, you dont really go back. Id suggest that if you can go with scratches, stick with them. , Call your local suicide hotline, and tell them that you need to go to the hospital because you think youre about to do something you dont want to; theyll call the police for you to get you immediate help, or give you details on checking yourself into a hospital., Ive never experienced the rush you describe. My blades are always pried from razors, which were not bought for that purpose..., Just to note, self-injury can be a controlled coping mechanism as part of an array of strategies, and if you chose, you can begin to wean yourself off SI over a period of time.I think the people who feel addicted are people without other strategies, and rely solely of SI to deal with their problems and emotions.OP, if you feel strongly about continuing SI, then please do so whilst developing other strategies; have someone youre completely open to, write lyrics/poetry/stories/a novel, have a helpline number attached to your computer screen or somewhere youll definitely see, elastic band method (google it), etc. You can avoid addiction by putting yourself in control. It isnt perfect; I relapsed 2 weeks ago after 4 months without cutting, but dont come down on yourself if you do try to stop and relapse, because that makes it worse - instead try to understand why and how it happened, accept that it happened, and soldier on., This is just my 2 pence... but if youre going to continue, you might want to choose less obvious places to harm.Like, I tend to cut my thighs, because they arent visible to the whole wide world. I used to do my upper arms, but that can be risky. See, if people see your injuries, youre going to get *a lot* of agro from it in the form of lots of people asking questions, over-concern, etc. And it can be really stressful and just make things worse for you.Id also suggest choosing a better means of injury, most people cut or burn, and they work pretty well. , It works just fine for me. Im safe, I allow myself to cut only as a last resort or when I just cant deal with something at all. I actually receive counselling/therapy, but Ive been Tired good at keeping them in the dark about this aspect of my life. Its my thing and it works, nobody needs to know, it doesnt affect anyone; theres no reason I should stop., Its an important place to start, because you cant begin to deal with anything else whilst youre struggling with alcoholism., You may think youre not Tired good at videos, but I thought that was brilliantly told; Tired powerful.It Pain me to see when people become addicted to cutting... Ive always felt that Im not addicted, and have a certain degree of control... I guess its once you become addicted that it becomes a problem., This has absolutely nothing to do with morals, it has to do with human rights, which supersede all moral and national laws. If you kill someone, it is murder. &gt; affirmative defensesBullshit argument that in reality means vigilante justice. In a lot of civilised countries, police dont carry guns, guns and deadly weapons are far more difficult to obtain, and as such our crime rates are lower. Look, Im not going to debate this any more, because this is /r/suicidewatch. The rules clearly stipulate that you are **not** allowed to incite or encourage suicide. This place is for suicide prevention **only**. If youre not going to try and stop OP from committing suicide, then either stop posting or Im going to report you and request the mods ban you from the entire subreddit for consistent rule breaking., Im sorry to hear that :/ Its a breach of trust on your moms part. It always hurts when someone breaches your trust, but its far worse when its someone Tired close to you. You have every right to feel angry, and annoyed, and betrayed - everything youe feeling right now is completely valid. That said, do try to take the perspective of your mom, and think about why she did what she did. Im not saying its okay, what she did was completely wrong, but you cant hold a grudge.Therapy can be really great, if you have a good therapist/counsellor. If you dont like the one youve been signed up to - for whatever reason - then you have to make that clear to your mom. But a good counsellor can really help you get your thoughts and emotions out there, and help you clear your mind. They shouldnt push you into immediately stopping - any good counsellor will recognise how important SH can be to us. So, I guess Im just saying that this might end up not being as bad as it might seem right now. But I do wish you luck, I hope you do okay in your exams and get through the therapy okay. &gt; I just wish I could be left alone. And yet Im still posting about it on Reddit?Its different online. Here, you have a screen between you and other people, you can be alone and with others at the same time :), I cut in the same place, and although I wouldnt say I take pride, Im certainly not ashamed of them anymore.I gue",Behavior,Behavior,Attempt

"Its hard online. Its just like trying to sell yourself like a product on amazon so image is way more important. I think you need to meet someone in real life, so go out a little more. Go to the gym, work on yourself. Most of us are ugly. Probably the girl you showed your picture to is ugly, she probably just had a little more good traits but shes probably still no more than average. Its Tired shallow of her. , Im sorry. Were you in a band?, As a BPD myself, my thoughts on this are that most people in the medical field (especially non-doctors) worked for their special 2 or 4 year degree in helping people so they can feel accomplished themselves. These people are good at school, thorough, competent with positive outlooks who usually have no idea how to be truly compassionate. The ones who make it through school (most of the time with a tough time) get out and have a little more compassion or are truly just blessed with seeing the world in someone elses shoes and understanding. Its not often you come across medical proffesionals like this. Most of them dont get past the helping people part in their mind.  When they are 18 applying for college they go in with the mindset, Im a normal person so I can just help all the crazy people by just being normal around them., Feeling much better today. I just hate when you never know when the Suicidal thoughts are coming. , Hope it ends well at least. Youre going to regret some things, but its true, some of the Pain of life are going to fade away right before your eyes. My thoughts are whatever lies ahead is just a repeat of a repeat and that youll be born again, and if thats true I hope you decide to stay longer next time. , What a bummer. I really cant imagine your life. Is there anything youve ever thought of that would improve your quality of life? Something you never tried?, I cant say a lot of people can even imagine the Pain you are going through right now. There are still somethings  I could suggest you might enjoy, like music, meditation and reading. Thats what I enjoy. I go to a course in miracles sometimes. They are really a loving group if you can find one around your area and attend. However, I also have Influenza-like Illness and can shit in a toilet on my own. To be honest, you make me feel so lucky as selfish as that sounds. Ive been so Depression lately and you make me feel like a ridiculous spoiled child. I dont know if telling you committing suicide is a bad or good idea because Im pretty Suicidal myself. A lot of people are, a lot of healthy people who have everything going for them, they end their lives everyday. So where does that leave you? I dont know. I dont know your situation enough and who is there rooting for you everyday besides the care giver, loving you and making sure you have what you need. Just continue to be as strong as you are, because its true youre much stronger than most to endure what you have to. And when times get tough, accept death is really just around the corner for all of us, so why not try and make the most of what you have left?, My mom tried to commit suicide twice in two years. Overdoses sent her right to the ER. Both times I thought she was dead, but the second time I really thought that. She had a stroke, couldnt talk or move, tubes down her throat, glazed over eyes, Watery eye Bloating symptom white skin, and pretty much brain dead, but somehow she snapped out of it and we somehow forgave her again. It was almost like someone out there gave her a second chance. The doctors said it was just another miracle. My sister also went to college for therapy because she wanted to understand more of my moms bipolar constantly being in and out of the mental wards all of our lives, but she eventually got Tired of it, switched to writing major and just got her associates. You cant live for your mom. You just cant. Youre too young and shes taking your life away and she really doesnt want that for you, she just doesnt know what else to do. Take care of her but remember you have your own life. Remind her of all the accomplishments shes made. A 600k house? A bmw? her own business? Those are HUGE feats barely anyone these days can accomplish, whether she lost it all or not. Remind her how proud you are of her and the great things she has done. I dont mean to say I had it worse but my mom was collecting Disability and a professional drug and alcohol addict almost all her life. They say, true freedom is getting everything youve ever wanted and then losing it. If thats true, remind her shes free of the burdens that the business and her divorce could have caused her. She can make a new dream and start all over now and if she can get back to dreaming and working towards those dreams, she might just take off after them again and feel better. , Must have been nice. You cant play at all now? If you dont mind me asking how did this happen?, Dont let the rapists take control of what you need to do to fight them. They might send around the video anyway if you tell the cops or not, but the longer you wait the less the cops can do and the more scared and harder it will be. Please dont be ashamed.

"You know what you should do?Instead of thinking about killing yourself, just pack up your stuff, and leave.  Leave everything behind.  Dont let this be the end of your life, but the start of a new one.  Dont live on the street, find a hotel to stay at, hitchhike, rent a car, whatever.   And your family probably doesnt think of you as a burden.  Imagine a burden you would be if you killed yourself; Depression on everyone, further financial problems with funeral costs and such, etc.Also think of dying this way: you will be sent into oblivion forever.  No, you wont know it, but you will not EXIST anymore.  Not eating, breathing, running, anything. Make your existence meaningful and dont throw it away carelessly. I hope you can find your way out of this., I can understand that. You would rather take your own life than die from drugs. Society is fucked up and I hate having to conform what right and normal to society. Sorry if I come off as annoying, I just know there are better and more options than just choosing death. You just have to find them. , That last option (besides dying on the battlefield) actually sounds like a great idea.  Just find away to leave (even fighting ISIS). Find something that doesnt require any sort of payment (since I am in a large amount of debt also, I know how you feel).Basically getting away from this awful sounding family of yours and finding your own purpose in life, instead of letting it slip away.I really wish you good luck., But you did make it, once.

"I think wed like to help you, but we might need more information. Can we just talk? Even if it feels ridiculous or like youre ranting, you might feel better and we might be able to address some of your concerns., Im doing a lot. Im taking some really stimulating courses at the university of my dreams. Im going to India this summer. Ive picked up hobbies - painting, old movies, classical music, slowly learning German. Ive picked up good habits after months of discipline. Ive worked on my physical health. Im not sitting on my ass, just feeling sorry for myself. I think Im far from that. I work Tired hard to try and carve out happiness. I have made efforts to better my life and better myself, but it all feels absolutely empty. I honestly believe that it will always feel this empty. If Im giving 100% and getting so little back, I hardly think continuing is worth it.I wont feel better if I kill myself, but at least then I wont feel anything. Look, youre not actually going to care if I kill myself. I know thats what people say through the internet, but its a hollow statement. You have no investment in me and youre not going to remember this in a week. I dont mean that to sound harsh, but its true., Well, lets talk about a few things that are going on here.First off, holy shit. You certainly did try to overdose. I am surprised that you were able to wake up.Secondly, you certainly do need help. You say that your friends and family arent an option. I can tell you that drugs are not an option either. Out of all the people Ive known to self-medicate, I cant think of one who actually benefited from using drugs. Why do you use drugs? Do they help you get through your problems (or Numbness your way through them)? Are they use around your environment?Im sorry that a relationship with your ex is not going to work out. Im proud that you finally realized it - isnt that the first step to eventually getting over it altogether? If it hurts to read that, maybe you dont want to get over it. What do you need to get off your chest concerning her in order to feel better?Lets just talk. Dont go running to drugs in order to Numbness this - youve got to get over this. Were here to help., I am here to talk, not judge you. If I overstep my boundaries, let me know and Ill back off.I want to you know that there is, without a doubt, hope for you. I have met people who most certainly do have social Anxiety and are able to not only function healthily eventually, but also become sociable. This isnt it for you - you can rise above this just like other people have. Let me just congratulate you on getting into uni. Please dont fall into the mental trap of thinking that everyone has a better social life than you do. I might be a poor poster child for these things (I tend to stay in my room and only go out one night of the weekend....if that), but most people are bumbling around. Its not what Hollywood or facebook portray, no matter how glamorous that shit may seem to some people.With that out of the way, you arent your Anxiety. Yes, you feel Anxiety and, yes, your actions are in response to the way you cant help but feel. However, I would try and separate yourself from the Anxiety you feel as much as possible. This might sound like confusing advice, but what it boils down to is swallowing your Fear and pushing ahead. Dont think about giving a presentation or trying to work your way through a roomful of people - just take baby steps. Work on introducing yourself and asking questions to people. Speaking of which, let me ask you a few things. What are you so afraid of? What is the worst thing that could happen, say, when you went up to that professor and asked a question? Are you afraid of looking dumb? Is it that the words just dont come out?I want you to know something Tired Pain that everyone has to learn - it has hit me rather hard, to be honest. Not everyone is going to like you. In fact, sometimes the majority of people in a room wont like you - even if youre not at fault. Thats not fair or nice, but Ive found that its true. However, that doesnt have to stop you from loving and liking yourself. Underneath that social Anxiety and Feeling Feeling nervous is YOU, and its important that you dont mix up your issue of socialization with your successes and positive characteristics in life. YOU are a good and interesting person. Your Anxiety is not you, even if it speaks loudest at times., There are no people who care about me. Not really. If I did, I wouldnt be writing about my problems on reddit.I appreciate your kind words, but, I mean, youre not a friend or someone who is really invest in my wellbeing. I dont really expect you to be either - this is the internet and I can be realistic., Food can be an addiction just as much as alcohol, gambling, and drugs. Your addition is just as legitimate as anyone elses. I will tell you that I had - and still struggle with - an addiction to food.I dont want to sound rude, but are you killing yourself on purpose or can you just not stop eating? Are you eating to specifically kill yourself?You need to talk to your wife and then reach out for help. The first step really is admitting that there is a problem. Now, you need to seek help. People recover from addiction and build normal lives. That can be you.Were you always obese? It sounds like you know what its like to be physical since you mentioned playing with dogs, hiking, and basketball. One of the toughest parts of helping food addicts is that they just dont know what theyre missing out on - but it sounds like you understand! Use those memories as inspiration as well as the thought of one day being a father and playing with your child.Its not about food. There is something else going on and I imagine that Depression is playing a large part in your problem. Open up to your wife., It sounds like there is nothing stable in your life. There doesnt seem to be anything or anyone you can count on. When its people, things get complicated because there are Emotional upset attachments that get mixed up in everything.So, you need to find something stable. Drugs seem stable, but of course theyre not in the long run. Unfortunately, even in the best of circumstances, you rarely find people who you can fully count on. That means youre going to have to end up finding stability in yourself. That doesnt seem fair or particularly fun, but I wonder what else you could really find stability in at this point.Your age is going to partly determine what you can find stability in beyond yourself. School, work, or hobbies are the usual answers, but thats because theyre usually the best. And maybe you have a shit job or classes suck or you cant seem to find anything youre good at - I can really relate to you there - but you have to try with at least one of these. Theyre your best shot. They may be your only shot for the time being.You seem Tired isolated and alone. Im sorry for this, because even the most Depression and aloof people Ive met have something to contribute and some of them are the most awesome people I know. It seems that you are going to have to work on you for a while - even though you have done nothing wrong., This is the way its always been, and its only going to stop when I finally make it.Night., I can relate. I transferred from a community college and into a university. I was already a couple years older than my peers, but I really thought that the transition would change everything.This is my third and final year. I have Tired, Tired few people who I know and no one here I would consider myself close friends with. No one to open up to. It really hit me a couple weeks ago that, despite all my attempts, Im still just as lonely as I was before I got here. Maybe even more lonely.I will break up my suggestions into two categories: The first of which relates to your academics. You need to figure out why youre in college. You sound as if youre already falling behind. Do you really want to be there? Are you just in college because thats what seems natural, what people expect of you? My experience is that there are a lot of young people in college who arent really excited to be there. Thats not good. Theyre getting into crazy debt and are having to fight tooth and nail for shit jobs post-graduation. Im not advising you leave school, but I would suggest you figure yourself out. There is nothing wrong with taking a year or two or five to work a job or travel. I didnt go to school right away and was much more mentally prepared for it when I finally decided the time was right.As far as friends go, you gotta get out. You have to physically get out there. I tried joining clubs - honestly, I embarrassed myself in more than one of them. There were others that I didnt like. It didnt always work out, but if I took ten shots and nine missed, at least I got one. At least one person talked to me and didnt think I was an idiot. I ended up doing a lot of things by myself and just got used to it. Sure, it doesnt help me make friends, but it gets me out and keeps me sane. I go to plays, concerts, movies, museums, etc by myself.The first year of university sucks. It does. But if you work at it, it can get better., http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html You need to call someone NOW.If you dont think you can make the call, please tell me why youre scared? Are you scared it will hurt? Are you afraid of yourself? Are you afraid of the consequences?Please DO NOT harm yourself. We are here for you., So, you do these things before people get to know you as a way to protect yourself?, I hate it when someone offers to listen to my problems only to then get bored after a minute. They throw out a Well, just think positive! and then become frustrated when I dont bask in the glory of their completely original suggestion. I hate that. It demonstrates that someone doesnt give a shit or even try to give a shit.I dont hate suggestions - even suggestions that I dont think will work - from those who genuinely care about me. These people listen and their ideas come from their interest in helping me. Just as I feel hopeless to save myself, they feel hopeless to save me too. They see me drowning in a whirlpool of my own misery and theyre willing to throw out damn near anything - life vests, chairs, arm floaties, saxophones - for me latch onto so that I can swim away from danger. So theyll mention going for a jog, meditating, talking to a therapist, and I try to be patient. Even if Ive tried out all these ideas or they just dont work for me, there is a teeny, tiny bit of comfort in the fact that someone has tried. Maybe not enough to inch away from the whirlpool, but enough to not get sucked in that night.But, yea, to the people who think throwing out a motivational quote should someone make you snap out of it? They can go fuck themselves., Yea, I would be surprised how much strangers care. I didnt mean to upset you, but Im being realistic. When I kill myself it will have absolutely no bearing on your life. If the amount of care I receive from people in my life now is all Im going to get, its not good enough to stop me from ending my life. Thats that. It would be wrong to just pin my suicide on my loneliness or blame other people, so I wont do that. Ill take responsibility for my actions. But its just not enough., I think thats part of my problem. I want to follow whatever pathway will give me the most amount of success or happiness - but I Fear these will be mutually exclusive. On top of that, I dont think it matters what I choose because Ill never be truly successful or truly happy either. I dont have the ability for the former and I dont even know how to approach the latter., What do you want to talk about? It can be as obscure or detailed as you like. Anything you need., Thank you. Everything ended three years ago. I thought that I had been able to move on, but Im slowly realizing that some of my ingrained behaviors and outlooks have been shaped out of the way I was raised. Its not that I dont want to take responsibility for my actions or my ideas, but rather that I dont know how to respond to reality because I wasnt raised in it. The website looks helpful. It certainly can be difficult to find people who have gone through similar experiences. Thank you again., My Depression comes and goes in waves, and my lack of a sex drive is one aspect of my struggle that I hate. Ill get somewhat horny and try to masturbate, but I wont be able to finish. I either get bored, stop, and try to ignore whatever urges Ive built up, or else I pretty much ~make~ myself finish and its so mechanical that its not pleasurable at all.Its frustrating because I just want to take care of my urges., I have trouble defining success and happiness. I feel so narcissistic saying this, but to be honest, I think I define success as being a big name. A mover. Someone who matters and influences the world in a big way. As far as happiness goes, I dont know how to define it. I dont know what it actually IS. I can say that I want a house and love and good food and stability and time to read and watch movies, but I dont really know. I know that happiness is supposed to be a journey and not a destination, but every time I achieve something, Im not happy because Ive got to look for the next thing to work on. I dont think I can be happy. I just dont know how.I have no goals. If someone told me that x would make me successful and/or happy, Id do it, whatever it is. Im going to graduate and then I have to figure things out. I feel so little compared to the people I work under. I want them to see me as an equal, someone who really has ideas to contribute. I think I DO have ideas to contribute, although Im still working on smoothing out my edges. But itll never be enough., There is a lot going on in your post. For some reason, even after reading through twice, the part about suicide being a cop-out sticks out to me. Your friend doesnt know what he or she is talking about. Ive had people tell me similar things, that ending your own life is cowardly, is running away, etc.These people have almost certainly never been Suicidal. To me, being on the verge of taking my own life is a lot like being backed up into a corner with no way out. The old ways of getting out - things that once made me happy, devices used to calm me down - dont work anymore, and Im squeezed tighter and tighter into a smaller and darker corner.What it boils down to, I think, is that you have to find a device to get out. Its either that or try to survive in the corner for as long as possible with the probability that youll eventually submit to the darkness. This isnt profound advice. I even think its annoying - because it sounds like you HAVE been trying. You HAVE tried to follow peoples advice and get out of the corner - but for some reason youre still stuck. Do you have any idea why you are the way you are? Why youve taken a sudden turn for the worst?, There seems like theres a lot going on in your life. What seems to be an overall issue is that no one believes you and in turn you have no one to talk to. After several years of this, its going to wear a person down. Hopefully, posting here will help relieve some Pressure and some people will be able to talk with you.It bothers me that your mother doesnt take your eating disorder seriously. Even in the event that you are lying about having an eating disorder (which I know youre absolutely NOT lying, Im just speaking hypothetically), then she should be concerned as to why you would lie about it. Either way, she should take these red flags seriously. I hope no one makes you feel guilty for not clicking with the counselor. I have never actually spoken to a counselor because I just dont think Id be able to find one Id like. Im sure this is not the answer Im supposed to give you. I think it WOULD be good for you to continue seeking help until you find someone you can work with - but that being said, a counselor is a Tired personal career. Its been over five years and I still cant find a dentist I like for Crying out loud.I really try to refrain from commenting Oh my god! I know how you feel! The exact same thing happened to me now let me one up you! However, I want you to know that I got rejected from uni several years ago. It took a lot of sacrifice and hard work, but I was eventually able to attend a school later. It is absolutely devastating to be rejected because we put so much focus on kids going to college - eighteen years of working up to it, and now you might feel like you have nothing to show for all that hard work.Once again, I hesitate to throw too much of myself into your problem. I will offer that I ended up meeting a lot of people who did not also go to school right away and who were able to create their own paths. It took a lot more work and creativity on their part, but their lives were far from over at 20. Some of them were the most badass people Ive ever met. Would you be able to get a job? I think for a lot of people, this is a good idea because it allows you to get out, get experience, and give you a reason to get out of bed every morning. When youre down and out, anything may help.Why do you think people arent taking you seriously? If you could do ANYTHING in life, what would you do?, Youre arent the only person though! I have a food addiction that I struggle with. It takes different forms - the form it takes for you is just as legitimate. It doesnt make any rational sense - thats why its an addiction. Think about the opposite end of the spectrum with Loss of appetite people. That doesnt make any sense either.I dont want to insult your wife, but if you are open and honest then she should believe you because shes your wife. Same with a counselor - they see all kinds of different problems.What it boils down to is that you have to take that leap and tell someone. Making yourself say it out loud will help you come to grips with your addiction. Right now youre stuck with only your thoughts, and you need the thoughts and support of other people. Please take the leap., Hey, how are you doing? It seems like theres been a few problems on your post since I last logged onto reddit. Once again, Im not interested in judging you, just talking. If I overstep my boundaries, let me know and Ill back off.I have to admit that when I first clicked on your post, I thought you feeling Suicidal over being a virgin was - to put it nicely - not something I could take seriously. However, if people heard the reasons I wanted to kill myself, Im sure Id get a lot of WTF?s. I think as people, we should try to control aspects of our lives and our reactions to situations, but suicide isnt exactly logical to begin with. Getting to that point is bound to be riddle with illogical ideas and overwhelming emotions. I want to clear something up, first off: the party scene you describe in college is a fantasy. It never exists for the vast majority of people, and when a lot of people say theyre going to party, it just means that its a lot of people sitting around, drinking, and, well yes, sometimes trying to hook up. I really thought I was missing out, until I had a roommate who was into the party scene. Man - it was a waste of life and energy. It was mostly people who fancied themselves the shakers of the world because they were young, good looking, and drunk. They had gigantic attitudes and judged people by shit that doesnt fucking matter. Ill never forget when my roommate told me that she runs this town. No, she didnt. She just wasted a lot of money on drinks and clothes and went out to get smashed and go clubbing. I always stayed in with a few beers and watched Netflix in my pjs.But, you could potentially make the argument that she learned to socialize more and, yes, she had sex (although meaningless sex, which sounds like something youre not all too interested in). I guess I cant argue too much beyond saying that the quality of relations she had were shit. I dont feel like I missed out on much, and, frankly, no one parties to find quality people to hang out with or to learn to socialize.Im going to move on. Now, I can only talk about myself personally, but I think it might hold true for other women: I dont like flirting. I dont think its a good tactic, because it feels like a guy is trying to be sly and get something out of me. I DO love having friendly conversations. Try to aim for the latter. This is when my advice echoes that of most of reddit: you gotta find something to talk about. The way you do that is by bettering yourself and getting a hobby. That way, when you see a woman holding a book, mentioning a type of food she likes, or what her goals are, youll be more likely to at least have some common knowledge on the subject and interact. If she thinks you kindly contributing to the conversation is creepy, then shes probably not a nice person. The tough part is that this has to happen naturally - its rarely going to work on the street, but itll fly in a break room or coffee shop.If you dont know any young, single women, then you dont know enough people. You gotta find something to do: a hiking group, a class, a community club - anything. Even if you show up and there are no available women youd be interested in, at least you have the experience to talk about later and youve met people.I would also suggest online dating. I know some people have mixed feelings over it, but I think its a wonderful tool. You can think about what you want to say before you put it out there, and you can be completely honest. I would mention that youre a bit shy. I like the idea of online dating because you can cut to the chase and just be honest. Sure, most people will pass your profile by, but it means that when someone does talk to you, you can know that theyre talking to YOU.I cant quite figure out why being a virgin is such a big deal to you. Im not trying to be an asshole, but I cant figure it out. I thought maybe you were a jerk who just wanted to get laid, but that doesnt seem to be it. I thought maybe you had some idealized version of romance, but that doesnt quite seem to be it either. How does being a virgin at 25 make you feel? Weak? Pathetic? Why? What does having sex mean to you? What would you need in order to not want to kill yourself over this matter?That was long winded and maybe not Tired helpful, but I just wanted to put all that out there and have no regrets later., Yea, I guess. But up until three years ago, it wasnt even a thought because of the religion I grew up in., I am a student who does work study at my university. My asshat boss did something similar a while ago. As he leaned back in his office chair, interlaced his fingers together and rested them on his belly, he said that he could tell I was going to end up alright in life and I wasnt one of the work studies he has to worry about. , Im not judging you, but Im interested in really trying to understand your situation. I hope this would be okay to ask: why do you think youve been unable to make these connections with others? Also, even if sex isnt the only goal, why is it such a centerpiece to you?, WHAT? I know lots of people who dont get married before the big 4-0 and there are people who wait to get married even after that!1) Youve had roughly ten years of your life when marriage was an option. Thats it! Thats not a lot at all!2) Youve been doing YOU! I mean, probably in more way than one, but theres nothing wrong with setting the life up you want by yourself.3) Most of the people I know who got married before their late twenties are divorced by now. Youre ahead of the game already!Why is marriage so important to you? Is it marriage or being loved? Why do you think its because youre unlovable as opposed to it just not happening yet? What do you need in life to be happy and why?, Whenever I go into one of my depressive cycles, my sex drive noticeably decreases. Even when Ill try to get off, I wont be able to finish, making me even more frustrated. On a regular basis, I have trouble getting off the way most other women do anyways, so that kinda takes a hit on my confidence overall.Do you think theres a connection between your Depression and sex drive? It sounds like you just have a low sex drive - thats not unnatural. Some people are just naturally less interested in sex. I would say there is no such thing as a real man. Its not your job to sexually satisfy a woman. Just because youre less interested in sex doesnt make you less masculine. There are women out there who would be satisfied in a relationship with little to no sex. But in my own way, I emphasize with you. Regular sex is Tired uncomfortable for me and so what I can do is limited. It probably contributes to my overall lack of confidence., Why do you say horrific things to people and destroy everything?, Everything happens for a reason. :)FUCK YOU.",Behavior,Behavior,Attempt

Granted I dont know how often you guys actually hang out, but why not set a date like on Fridays to Skype or have a long phone conversation.  Watch the same movie and talk to each other about it.  , That makes sense honestly. , Well talk to us :) We care and want you to know that!, Where to begin.Compared to my brother, my mom blames me for everything... keep in mind- im in college and almost done, he is a felon that does nothing with his life... but I guess where the heart is for her.  My dad honestly just doesnt seem to care to step in and tell her to knock it off.Relationships: I have been with 5 guys total and always get Pain.  Current bf never talks to me, I maybe see him every 2-3 weeks.  He reads my messages but never responds so yet again, proving that dating... I am worthless.School is the only thing I have going for me, but even with a year left... I am just done.Work is the same worthless feeling... I do so much but nothing gets seen or appreciated so I feel worthless. I have bipolar Depression and GAD... I cut myself already.... summed up version I guess., There are other things as well that a friend sent me... I think one of them was drawing on your wrist making it look like you were bleeding, then pouring like warm water that is colored like blood over it to make it look and feel as though you are bleeding. , It does take a lot to stop. With the cutting, I put it in a container, filled it with water and put it in the freezer- that way, if I get the urge to cut, I have to wait for it to thaw out.  , With pills... it really is a try until it works.  I was put on Celexa, worked fine for a bit and then I started cutting.  Then my Dr. put me on a trial med and it worked, but was so expensive that I did my research and found something similar that had a generic. While you may not have the money to seek professional help, does your school offer counseling services to students? If so, start with them.  Just explain that you want to talk and see what they have to say.You are a good person; dont let your parents bring your mood down.  You got this.  You are strong.  I am here to help any way that I can because I know what it is like to not have someone to talk to. , Most run away from it though... and I do talk to my dad... he was the person I asked if I should get on a pill for it or not, Be proud you are continuing school, even if it is community college.  You are bettering yourself either way!  Responsibility of adulthood is tough, I had the same feelings you do right now when I graduated college, but it gets better.  Im starting my last year of college, am already in a management role at my work and have been tapped by other managers to succeed an open position higher up in leadership (pending interview), and I love the people I surround myself with. Sure times will seem tough and you will ask yourself why am I doing this or can I do this, but I assure you, you can do anything if you stay determined and positive. :), Ill try., Well in the end you should study what you want to study!  My dad wanted me to be a Dr., I attempted to do nursing school and once I was actually in that program I got so Stress that I resigned.  I went for what I wanted and now I am happy in that aspect- so go for what interests YOU, not THEM. Communicating via on here or on any website isnt wrong or anything.  I think a lot of us dont like to talk to actual people in life (I have bi polar Depression and GAD, so.. .I actually avoid people like the plague with the exception of work and school. Are you currently taking any medications to help?, Hey man Im here to listen if you ever want to talk.  There is nothing wrong with taking a medication or talking about what is bothering you in order to function normally. , Would be more than willing to talk to you :)School is certainly a tough thing.  Honestly, I sought help with my Depression and Anxiety from my Dr. because it was getting worse each year.  I think the Stress for success comes from the major itself, can you tell me what it is you are going to school for? Have you considered changing majors to something to see if that makes it better? , I understand :/ I also hate social situations and struggle with making friends.  An example of me is like the kid from Perks of Being a Wall Flower... Im just in the background and if by some chance someone wants to be friends, ok ill try but am hesitant. , PM me and lets get a conversation going! You can tell me about your hobbies, favorite books, movies, music, etc. :)  I know the feeling man-- I get this way to because I am often just shuffled aside and no one really talks to me , Grades arent everything.  I struggled with my grades, mainly because I was more focused on friends and video games.  Once I focused more, studied more etc., I did better.  Do you have distractions in your life that are impacting your schooling?  Have you reached out to a school resource like a learning center or tutor to get help?You are still young and as you said have a ton of potential still so dont give up bud!  You can do whatever you want in life if you set your mind to it.  If you ever want to talk you can certainly PM me and ill talk to you.  , This.  Some of the smartest and well-off people didnt do well in school. , Always willing to listen and help when needed.  , Well I can tell you man that since I started my medication (which treats both my Depression and Anxiety with just one pill), my mood has improved.  Some people do need both.  Have you talked to your Dr. about this before?, I have told him about it.  He said he is ok with it and understands the whole Depression thing.  It is tough for me to let people in to where I know I wont get physically/emotionally Pain. The assault was my fault- I was black out drunk and had it coming.  I didnt tell anyone but by parents and maybe my best friend.  I didnt call the police either.  Instead, I went and bought a gun because I am so scared to even leave my house., Sometimes though the breaks are a good thing, While your story is no different than what a lot of people, who you are as a human being is still the best thing out there.  You cant stick to the shit parts of your life, try to move on.  VA lines no shock to me that they arent a help given what we see in the news about the VA-- with that said, I would highly recommend trying another hotline that will better assist you man, Ive tried that though... Ive tried to force myself into crowds or find a place I feel safe... nothing works.  I have been open with people, but at the same time I look at it as... I work to escape from my problems and go to school as well.  No one wants to date me as a result... My family aside from my dad hates me.... I just dont know. , Always here to listen, just PM me. I was the same way.  I went and talked to my Dr. and she started an anti depressant.  Here is the thing.... you may have to have a higher dose, or a different med.  I had to get my dosage higher and now it is working fine., What makes you worry about meeting up with said friends? Why are you struggling with school?  I dont think suicide is the answer buddy.  I think talking is what is best :)  Grades dont define a person.  You define yourself.  What is it you are specifically afraid to tell your parents?  It seems from what I could guess they already know about the grades and thus blocked all forms of communication.  Talk to me :) Id love to help as I have been down this same road , Well that is a good thing :)  Cutting is a hard habit to break, I used to do it a lot , Basing it off the TL;DR as it is a long post.do you suffer from PTSD perhaps from the abusive father aspect of your life? How long were you and the bf together before breaking up? What are you doing to treat your Depression? Look at the positives: you seem like a Tired, Tired awesome guy given the shit you have been through.  You are going to school, what do you want to be? What are some of your goals in life?  Dont think about killing yourself because that isnt the solution.  , If film is what you enjoy, go for it! :)  The sky is your limit.  When you create a movie, be it Oscar winning or straight-to-DVD film, I want to know the title because I am sure it will be great!, Could be you didnt study the right way :) Things change through college so dont give up!  I thought I wouldnt make it after I resigned from Nursing School... but then I changed majors and now I am on my last year. , omg same here, Hey man I havent been on in awhile.  How are things going?, Though it may be tough if you breakup, focus on school :)  Relationships can be fixed.  As I have experienced this with my boyfriend, well now ex, is the relationship on the rocks because youre busy with school?",Behavior,Ideation,Supportive
"Little bit of both I suppose. Ive had some pretty bad anxiety/panic attacks this year and one of them featured a lot of thoughts of Suicide. I realized that it was more that I was Social fear of one day committing Suicide than I was actually doing it, but it was one hell of a weekend. I found this subreddit looking for advice, and since then I just kind of browse through it once in a while just in case theres a post where I feel I can help. First time actually commenting though. I definitely dont have my life together though. , Oh the conversation is fine, no worries about that. Im also a 21 male, but Im from the U.S., I know that feeling. Everyone always says that the first step is the hardest, but I think the second one is. Ive gained some weight since leaving High School, not too terrible but enough that its noticeable, and every time I try to get on a program to lose it I end up giving up. But this past year I started going to the gym with some friends, and I made them promise me that they would drag me there if they had to because I know that I would try and back down. And even though the first week sucked, Ive seen some pretty great improvement in my muscles. Is there anyone in your life that could help keep you motivated? , Hey man, Im down to talk about anything., So youre responsible for why everyone assumes I want to become a teacher! No, but really that is an amazing coincidence! Life is crazy.Im perfectly cool with either PMs or talking on here, I browse Reddit on my phone pretty frequently so Ill see either. Have a good night man! , Maybe opening up and talking to these people would really help. Even if they do live far away, they can still help you. My best friend lives almost six hours away from me, and we havent lived in the same town together since we were 12. But I know I can always call him if I need something and he knows he can always call me. I think your friends and family will surprise you. As for the transitional period, boy do I feel you there. Im over halfway through college, but Im majoring in English and it is not fun to have everyone constantly tell you that the only job out there for an English major is a teaching position. It makes me nervous for the future, but Im still hanging in there. What are you planning on studying?",Ideation,Ideation,Attempt
"Dont feel guilty. Better than doing nothing, get someone(his family or a friend) to show him that he is cared for. If you get a chance you could go personally and help him. For now keep him encouraged. Try to cheer him up and distract him from these thoughts., I understand how you feel. I also get such thoughts. If you need a friend, Ill be there for you(you can PM me). Dont waste yourself. You are a blessing to this world.Your family will feel Tired sad. BTW, its better you try taking that anti-depressing medication. Please throw away the gun. , True. Everyone has a guardian angel. ",Supportive,Supportive,Supportive
"And another thing if you feel you dont have enough friends you should sign up to some sort of club, so you can meet for people; a tip I got from someone else., I think it would be extremely selfish of you to end your life when there are people out there that actually care about you like your five friends, and I would feel pretty bad and guilty if you did commit suicide because I would feel responsible because I couldnt do anything to help.So you know that there are people that do care Itll get better I promise.",Supportive,Supportive,Supportive
"and for the most part they do hell its just think of dealers as exotic pharmacist , luck bitch slapped and left me behind long ago, try me , there is no point of existence or bothering to survive , i have already tried meditation its part of my spirituality but i see myself as damned so nothing matters i linger on nothing changes and i know that one of these days the loneliness will break me i appreciate your advice but im sorry it does not help, i bought the wort we will see how it works..., im not dead yet but sometimes one needs a distraction and thats what drugs where to me and the growing scar on my wrist is and now my twisted logic says if one is good both will be better, i wouldnt even really know where to look for one and i am not Tired mobile i can barely afford the Excessive upper gastrointestinal gas to get to and from work that is one of the reasons i decided to post on reddit i spend most of my down time online already, perhaps i am ill give you that but it changes nothing about my perspective on life, im allergic to weed and as for my mother i have distanced myself from her so if i break i hope it will not Pain her so much and as for changing i have tried but the sorrows and my past are always just below the surface and one little word spoken by the ones that dont understand brings it all back no matter how good of a mood i achieve hell it happened just before i posted this i was smiling having one of my better days and the guy i live with said one innocent thing and i was ready to die in an instant, Death is the great liberator he frees our souls i Fear him not in fact i think in know him well i crave his embrace to free me from this hell, i wrote it years ago 06 i believe so my hate has faded to Depression , this is so true if only they knew , for all my honour life has done nothing for me all i ever wanted is simple enough but alas it is never to be mine, im not sure it would help my issue is im alone despite having people who care i dont have a partner and they dont matter much to me due to this im fucked up in that i cannot feel complete without someone in my life and with every passing day i become more convinced that i will never find someone thus i see death as liberation , im alone ive been rejected so any times in just to Tired to keep trying , ill try but i still want my roommates nuts, i have been kicked by to many Christians and the Muslims i have encountered my opinions are based in experience , unhealthy yes it is but it is what fills my time i live in the past for the most part which is a part of the spiral of sorrow and Depression i have i remember everything and it haunts me every hour i mentioned shit im not proud of doing but did not elaborate so here it is when i say 2 years ago is when i fell it is because 2 years 8 months ago i turned to pills and started self medicating so when i lost them i crashed i thought they would make everything better instead they just postponed it all and when i was sober it hit me and i have never recovered, In my Weakness of hand i hold a roseit is not white for i am not innocentit is not red for i feel not lovefor it is black the color of my hearti wished for love once but now i am wiseri wished for lust but the fire is fadedbut most of all i wished for you my beautiful onebut now i am beginning to see we will never benow i hold my rose looking to its velvet darknessthere i find peace and the knowledge of the dark truthi still love you or do i know even howfor a darker truth stillhow could i ever truly love anotherwithout first learning to love myself, meh you will hear from me before then i dare say anyway night , i understand how you feel im gay and i spend time thinking about dieing i have stood on bridges watched semis done drugs mixing uppers and downers its kind of surprising im still alive i cant tell you it gets better but i can say that just existing sucks.......i hope you find happiness friend, to late any ha yes lets bake cookies as if im not fat enough still it hurts i can not bring myself to cut to deeply, i have come back before ive done it when i droped the two i went looking for a new friend not part of that life a new guy at work i helped seemed coolthen he breakes out a pipe as well i cant escape it i try and there it is again its almost comical how closely it resembles a greek tragity and yes my death would Pain them but logicaly i cant help but think it would be less and far easier to handle than what a lifetime of what ive managed in 24 short years, you are not alone who ever said it is better to have loved and lost is a callous b***h but it is not over for every door that closes three more open im right there with you i spend alot of time thinking about suicide i went thru a bad time with drugs but i have cleaned up i have made a few friends and they r there when i need them  it can get better and it does i agree with amputeenager go to a few 12 step meetings find people who understand and with them by your side it wont seem so hopeless , thats the problem ive been Depression for over a decade and have had no happy moments that have inspired me to write just my misery and ive forgotten how it is to live without it, Ive waited years already this is not a new mindset for me its just getting worse, i kept myself drugged up on every narcotic i could for 6 months it didnt help and i do not have much hope for this, i do this every day at work and with my room mates, Im right there with you bro only the drugs i did and am tempted to get back on are far more dangerous and could kill me on accident but them again that was the original point it just shows how bad im getting that im considering doing them again, i doubt it and i would never tell any of this to my job i cant afford to get fired, no i do not Im Tired alone i just have my straight roommates who dont understand, yes it gives me a massive Migraine and i feel like shit for a Asthenia i was a pill poper and i have smoked other hard drugs but cant smoke weed i am probly going to repeat this pattern with cutting mixed in im just waiting for him to not be around, dont smoke weed but drink yes please, all i do anymore is think about my reality and how others see it i have talked many long hours with them i can see their view but none of them can see mine im just so Tired its not worth it anymore my joys in life are gone my sense of humor has gone to dust nothing changes and i only get worse, is your friend mike a druggie i was and am still tempted to do it again and so many guys......its one of the loneliest feeling in the world to be standing up while everyone else is sitting down i have been myself and went for what i wanted......you can only take disappointment so many times before you break, it leads to a loss of joy even Feeling unhappy leaving only madness , who? ive always been distant from my family and now ive purposely estranged myself from them my one and only true friend and room mate the only reason i havent yet self destructed is having heart surgery tomorrow morning so im not asking him for help im letting him do what he needs im proud and it will kill me i think and humanity is evil truly compassionate people like mother Teresa are maybe once a century others are false saints who just want the adoration , yes and nothing changes just as i have stated, Well even if i was willing i live paycheck to paycheck and have no insurance i have tryed talking to my friends but none of them get it hell i always was the one helping them and now that im fallen i have no one to turn to, fuck it im going to finish my beer and see how far i can go, your not the only one, never view anything as nonsense or useless after all you learned that it does not work and such experiences are the beginning of wisdom, honour is dead , ya i know that one but is sucks so much to do, i am everything i never wanted to be i was a drug addict i self medicated mixing uppers and downers trying to kill myself i failed obviously i have promised a close friend i wouldnt do it again but i have im failing miserably at quitting smoking i wear my past on my sleeve which im pretty sure has scared off the perfect guy i cut myself recently and im pretty sure im going to do it again all i want at this point all i deserve is to die i would prefer to go in my sleep but that could take years but im to much of a coward end it myself i dream of waking up in the emergency room and hearing hes not going to make it this quote sums it up / No more joy - No more Feeling unhappy - No emotion - Only madness. I cant see. I dont feel. I cant touch. I dont heal., what is st johns wort exactly , if my mother lost me she would not be far behind me i dare say but i have spend considerable time distancing myself from her (moving to a different state and not really calling helps) to try and protect her from my Depression and i hate my existence , Im considering ending my life tonight and am sharpening my knives anyway i hope you survive try and find something to cling to....but take my advice and dont make it someone u love or like me your heart will be taken away, yes i have more im going to post when i have the energy, just poetry and none of it happy, i love and miss the worst person that ever influenced me i love and live with the best man ive ever meet i would be with forever if he was gay and now all i have is the worst and will embrace it to kill myself by ODing on it i think ive gone past being Depression into pure self destruction , ya been on one for over a year only one guy who is under 50 has talked to me and he flaked out and as for the focusing ya i know its a bad idea but he is perfect and im pretty sure he was kinda interested until my damned roommate decided to open his mouth trying to help me (i just wanted someone to talk to while i took it slow getting to know the guy) after that it got weird so idk i personalty think that when he found other people knew he got scared, Hope is worthless all it causes is suffering and everyone is suffering in some way, 6 months i have been this way for years over ten i stopped counting and i know how it feels to be dead inside so dead that lifa and death taste the same to me , then how do you interpret it?, that is your right was just wondering why, my willpower is not so good i have 4 days off and im Tired much considering getting high and cutting i am a gay guy i live with a guy i really want to be with and every day is another rejection and it makes me worse, decided to look at your posts so your a Muslim.........i believe they teach suffer not the witch to live and gays are to be stoned to death.....I Tired much doubt you could ever help me with your faith screaming for my death.....you see that would be a conflict of interest, mmmm well im 23 if that helps and why u hate yourself i explained myself what is your story, I wrote this years ago when i first realized that i was gay and the first guy i was ever with turned out to be a bastard that only used me to get off when his girl was on her period, at this rate my roommates hate me i am to much of a downer im going to wait for my day off when they r both gone and see just how deep i can cut sorry but i am no pillar of strength you waste your time on me, The world can be cruel but never give up if she dosnt work out keep looking just dont let yourself become isolated , if you want i could post my own poem (well the best one i wrote in my opinion) from back when i still had the inspiration to write but it as with so many things........i just cant find any comfort in it anymore so i quit, My mother is worse than i am she could Tired well go off the deep end if i ever told her and we live in different states now, but exceptions are made i figured by your user name u where a girl but u used mate im confused i thought that was a word guys used but im not from england so not sure, no my favorite poet did http://www.nconnect.net/~cobra/index2a.htm, i dont want them to know about my issues and how far ive fallen, well its more that without girls i might be able to get the guy i want and be ?happy? maybe so ya if that makes sense, no they dont go away they only get worse , another issue im a gay guy and i live with two damned breeders who go on and on about all the girls tey are getting with and it reminds me that i am alone i cant talk to them and about anything so ftw i want to get off, yet you choose a faith that hates gays so much there is a group in canada dedicated to getting gays out of its homeland to keep them from being murdered, i enjoyed reading, gaming, and writing but the passion has left me, i will i guess, i have lived in 4 states in the last 5 years i have gone out met all kinds of people loved and only been pithed i am loseing my faith in my gods and with every day im dieing a bit more i was moving going out never sitting still but now i have stopped and cant gather the energy to try again i live with a guy i am madly in love with .....and he goes out of his way to let me know he is straight and im waiting for him to go on his Asthenia vacation out of states so i can get spun out and cut myself without him knowing, i reach out here because im close to the day i chose to end myself when i was 15 i decided id wait ten years and next month on august 23rd i turn 25 and ive planned out a OD i believe will end me....im looking forward to it ive meet the perfect person but it will never happen and im done looking, i resisted the urge for years and have already started, i am not on any meds i refuse to and i dont have a doctor and no insurance even if i trusted them and as for how long i have been Depression 10+ years i dont really remember anymore nor do i care to the weight has just grown so heavy i can barely preform my job i alienate people as far as i can tell and i have met a few amazing guys but here read my first post http://www.reddit.com/r/Depression/comments/tokd5/nothing_matters_life_is_worthless/ the ive done drugs i have cried for help no one hears and no one has really cared, arizona is not know for its good medical aid of any kind to its residents, everyone i ever gave a damn about and that i ever wanted to be with, i am a pagan death to me is peace and sleep with my goddess i long for and pray for death every day this is how far gone i am and from it i do not see a way back, Also the main thing that has stopped my Suicidal tendencies in the past is a good friend of mine that i promised i would stop hurting my self and abusing drugs and alcohol in a twisted game of russian roulette i did stop all that but with every passing day i care less and less about keeping my word and he is not here to physically stop me anymore, He is a Tired good and decent guy he is what i always dreamed of finding but if he is gay he is not out yet but i know he hasnt been with girls either so idk what to do anymore i have been like this for years and if i cant love myself who will i spend so much time thinking of taking Bobby Griffiths example, not as sorry as i am, and i do have my own world in my mind the problem is in that vision all i am is lord of misery sorrow and strife sitting on my crumbling throne living in the past no hope for the future.......im broken , in all honesty i dont know anymore, i highly doubt that i have looked everywhere i am alone so Tired alone nothing matters, i just like getting spun out, ten years of talking to all kinds of people across several states and never finding one who wanted to date me but plenty that just wanted to use me and some of the shit ive done to myself drugs (clean right now but it is a daily struggle to stay that way) and other self destructive tendencies i have developed seem proof enough to me... , years and years of disappointed love im alone and i hate it nothing changes and im so far gone in my Depression that i no longer think anyone could ever love me, beacuse i know them...her my mother suffers from a Depression that makes me look like a ray of sunshine among other issues...i told her if she COULD i was hurting a little for food she couldnt help and no one could get ahold of her as she lay in bed for 2 weeks feeling like shit SHE WILL NEVER KNOW ABOUT THIS EVEN IF I HAVE TO GET MYSELF DISOWNED and i think i have accepted that i have ruined all the friendships i had formed here im going to do my best to move in the next 2-3 months and vanish from the lives ive affected here without a trace and am considering the life of a hermit from that day on , no more joy no more Feeling unhappy no emotion only madness i can see, i dont touch, i can feel, i dont heal, survive is what we have to do and hope something comes along i think it would be better if i didnt live in this damned valley but there is nothing i can really do at this point except talk to people and stay on the hook up site im on hoping for a distraction , the worst part for me is i work with an amazing guy the same shifts and right next to each other he knows i really like him but does not seem to care every night its just another reminder of how lonely i am, if you have felt it i am sorry for you i have been the way i am for 10 years nothing matters every time you try you just fall harder it is pure self destruction and loathing in one when all you can imagine anymore is how you want to die and be forgotten......i truly hope you have never felt it, No and i will not i refuse to be drugged up in my mind if i can not find happiness on my own terms then it is better to die than have a false joy dependent on drugs......ive done drugs to self medicate all it does is Numbness you it fixes nothing, death or healing pills are capable of each the question is what do you seek i wish you luck precious one it is so sad you feel the need for death but i have no right to judge for i am so near that place myself, i just slept for over twelve hours and i still feel like shit, talk to her, with supportive friends and a good atmosphere it helps me but when im having a really shitty day no, never said you where only that your chosen faith kills pagans and gays, no i have not and i dont think i ever will they will just try to get me on meds i think which is something i refuse to do, i chose 25 i gave myself ten years now i have a little over a month till im there august 23 im planning the biggest OD ive ever done ive meet the perfect person but it will never be and im finished ill survive or i wont thats all there is but i dont think i will in my mind its time to end this melodrama , i used to write years ago but it quite helping im focused on the one thing i desire most which is a boyfriend it is what i need to feel complete until then im a fragment and im close to shattering im Suicidal and it should scare me but it does not ill PM you one of my old poems, i have a dangerous mentality for extremes my greatest desire is a partner to love and loves me i will literally do anything for the smallest chance i hated drugs swore never to touch them tho i spent years around people who did them yet when a bi guy wanted me to with him and do shit later i threw all my morals out he said it was just for a good time didnt date guys and yet like all people i have a grand potential for bullshitting myself even when i know it will turn me into a monster, everyone close to me already knows......ive talked to them all but i am a faggot in a sea of breeders they cannot and i think in many cases dont want to understand, If self destruction is an art i was an artist.....not proud of it and thus why im gonna try and not fall back into it, I know how you feel but after i always feel like crap for feeling like that without them i would already be dead Ive had to be physically stopped several times Im pissed that they care but happy at the same time the question is which feeling do you like more, haha i live in Arizona and no i have not i will not infe3ct them with my darkness i found the perfect guy and i do believe i have lost him, I personally believe that Depression is caused by circumstance and not genetics and that kids being innocent as they are pick up on whats around them so if your parents are Depression for any reason it can and will rub off on you , Ive been strong ive keep it together for years but i dont care what they say about hard times now i just want peace no one can fight themselves alone forever a bottle of vodka mixed with uppers is what i more or less live for the nights i cant remember and have no Pain like the one before last , he needs positive people in his life for months ive been thinking that the best thing i could do for him is go separate ways, i dont suffer in silence but the guys that are close to me dont understand and they dont want to, i dont have a phone but if u have skype i can do that, I will be more than willing to listen and to help you as i can i have similar thoughts PM me anyttime, im right there with you im just waiting to lose all hope and have a plan of my own, there you go, i can always try well friend i must sleep for work and let me know if u did want me to post a pic and give me your opinion.....i think im ugly as fuck, i know how you feel i always feel like it would just be better to go into a Coma and never wake up, i remember each and every man i have ever liked i have never gotten over any of them how will this one be different Im pessimistic cynical and Depression who the hell would ever want to be with me i spend so much time praying in the shadows of my bed before sleep to die i do it every night Im lost, i get paid in a few days ill see if there are any health stores near me i guess, yes i am but that would require energy im just fine fading away like i am slowly doing, well as a gay man i find the (no homo) crack annoying but as i have myself pondered suicide all i can offer you is find out how serious he is and if she breaks up with him be there for him i would probably be dead if not for a good friend of mine who didnt let me out of his sight for a Asthenia when i had a breakdown i hope this helps, i refuse to see a doctor or therapist in my eyes if i cant find happiness on my own terms i would rather die than be a anti-depressant zombie and its not lack of people who care that is a issue i just hate being alone its my greatest Fear in a way so many years i have been this way, hope is the first step on the road to disappointment and i have suffered to much in these last few years i just feel broken unable to love myself , im not a gambling man and im curious are u a guy cuz call me an ass all u want i have a pathological hatred for all girls my age i see them as the root of my sorrow no offense intended, and dude my loneliness and Depression are not from lack of friends or people who care its loneliness  of a different sort that is eating me alive, the fact that we dont shows we are good, sex drugs and rock and roll......ya i still cling to hope, your moving to the states why this place sucks ass i would love to be in england and no they will noy so many of my peers are so happy im just a black sheep, I know your Pain they look at me but they dont see me they dont care and they dont want to, i cant smoke weed i have a chemical intolerance to THC so ya what i did was a lot more intense but it made me happy a false induced happiness maybe but its better than misery my friend which has been my one constant companion for so many years now to quote godsmack serenity where do we go when we just dont know and how do you relight the flame when its Common cold why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing i am nothing......my roommate who i wish was mine does not help.......he really tries but he does not understand how, the places with good memories are in different states food has lost most of its appeal to me i only eat now when my body demands it and looking is no fun it is a reminder of what i dont have, well i am on several dating sites 2 are exclusively gay the other is not they are gay.com adam4adam and i also use plenty of fish so that is one i have tried in the year i have been on them only guys old enough to be my grandfather have tried to pick me up and im not going to drink and pop to kill myself im gonna do it to drown my sorrows for a few hours and the chance of death well i have high tolerances and have done much worse than what im planning.....do you want to see what i look like? i personally think i am ugly as fuck, Depression becoming indifference i know your Pain im there myself give it a year or two and you will no longer care just dont become as Suicidal as me or as i see in no longer caring if your dead or alive, and a note i just got to listen to another of his raps that he thinks will make me laugh but makes me want to throw myself in front of a semi ya life and hope is soooooooooooo grand.....not, do you have anything against gay people?, im high as a kite and drunk right now playing with my knife and there is a loaded shotgun in the house....im always right i predict months in advance what will happen how it will end but still i try until the last bitter note my ability to read between the lines is amazing i notice and remember everything and worse i can put it all together no matter how thick the lies and bullshit are i am a ordained priest dedicated to truth....and i have it but the truth can be the most terrible burden of all my passions are my demons and they are like a quote i love so much three passions simple but overwhelming strong have governed my life the longing for love the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind but a damaged person who cant save himself is powerless to save others ive failed my calling and long for the peace of sleep in my goddesses arms, it is not i have become empty and i just dont have the power to change it, how can you i dont even believe in myself anymore, i would almost welcome it i feel so alone they do not get it breeders never do, well i dont think the OP will listen if he is anything like me....im also like you the only reason im alive is friends that stopped me when i was using so many pills mixing uppers and downers chasing them with alcohol with the intent of killing myself they would wrestle my shit from me (they always where watching me after the first time i tried and almost succeed judging from how slow my heart rate was-one of them was a CNA) my heart Pain me every day now at some point so im pretty sure im close to a heart attack i am just waiting for it and unfortunately for many sex is the coping mechanism without it Depression gets worse....i personally have given up on life i hang around cutting when it gets to bad waiting for something to change but it never does im still waiting for the it gets better but i dont think so im nothing and the only question left is will i finish it myself or just fade away, he dosnt understand or have any idea how to help i am set im hoping he feels regret about that when the ground beneath me is stained scarlet, im afraid of falling apart completely, ugly you cant have anything on me i think and drugs well i know that path all to well and trust me it is not worth its the drugs are a dam and when you run out of them it sucks everything crashes down on you PM me if you need someone to talk to i have never had a relationship and i know how bad it can suck to be alone, doubt it i have traveled far and wide lived in many places im done looking, o i try and there are no gay places around where i live i have checked so im kind of isolated and i dont think me and him would be drama hell with the way whores treat him i dare to say i would be a vast improvement for him but......you can lead a person to water but you cant force them to drink..., im not a social person i have considered doing what you say but it is beyond what i am capable of i know you are trying to help me but fuck im just not able to help even myself all i can do is wait and hope while resisting my self destructive tendencies which is to tell you the truth a battle i am swiftly losing instead of that wort im planning on buying some pills and vodka im sorry......even tho i have never met you know that i appreciate your talking to me and love you all the same for it, im just Tired used to rejection it is one of the leading themes im my life, i daresay i have made an ass out of myself again well damnation i not suprised well i work nights so long, No one is waiting for me im far to gone in self loathing if i cant love myself how can anyone love me or i truly love them that is one of the darkest truths i have discovered , my knife is sharp i literally am holding it to the arterie in

craved have had no time for me i have spent the years in thought and it all comes to the same conclusion , same here i just dont want it to be old age , ive moved all around the country already and its all ended up the same..., its his mind and personality that make me want him sex is easy finding someone you want to spend years and possibly forever is not, im well aware however even the temporary escape is worth it, im just so Tired of my fate, A path to happiness sits not 5 Oedema of extremity from me but so far he does not want me i do not believe Depression is a disorder like they claim but a result of a reality that sucks to endure, my brother on spirit but not in blood, Summer sucks, it has nothing to do with a break up im just a gay guy in love with my roommate its the years of never having ever dated and being completely alone in this way that is killing me, you just need to get out hey hell im 23 and have never dated if you want the story check my post just dont give up

"No need for thanks it just makes me happy that it maybe helped someone else., I would never wish muchless wish someone to take my burdens. I just wanted you to know you arent alone, Im twenty three years old and my body (as told by doctors) is that of a sixty year olds within due to an accident I was in. I was hit by a truck when I was eleven and Ive been battling Depression since. My nana  the one and only person in my world that understood died Oct 1st 2002 and I was hit on Apr 15th 2003 when my birthday was on May 28th. It sucked massively and since that age I was homeschooled but I had to teach myself. No teachers. No friends. No nothing.. my mom had taken to hitting me a lot and really breaking me down physically, emotionally, and everything the year my Nana got Illness and we were taking care of her and that was when I was 9. My bio father has been in and out of my life and Ive been Illness since I was two years old. My dad didnt want me cause I was a Illness kid and have done nothing but get worse. Ive been raped and many other things I cant go to college due to seizures and I cant do what my heart desires.. Im so sorry for your Pain but you are NOT alone in it, yes its all different to everyone but the common is that we understand.I know it seems your life is hopeless and isnt going anywhere. I know youre ignored and not heard but I hear you and I feel you. As much as it would be freeing what happens when right before you hit it blinks in your mind STOP.. Ive downed a bottle of pills before, i used to cut, used to choke myself but never could finish it no matter how bad I wanted to no matter how badly I needed to because at the end right before blanking out my brain would scream stop.

"While my peers were partying and going to college I was in therapy trying to learn to like myself enough to be willing to live a little longer. My husband had enormous financial and social success, but his life was hollow until he devoted himself to getting whole emotionally, moving to a new city and closing one of his businesses to do a particular therapy. We have both benefited enormously for decades from getting help for our Emotional upset distress.There are lots of well meaning incompetents out there, but if you can find a good therapist and you make it your highest priority, it might help buffer you against the sense of being overwhelmed by lifes ups and downs. It certainly did for us. For me personally, being true to myself even when it is embarrassing or difficult is critical to my will to live, even after all these years. Therapy isnt a panacea, but sometimes just unpacking all the Pain and Fear and giving it a good airing reduces it to its proper proportion and makes it less overwhelming. Your suffering is heartfelt. If you use it to gain insight it wont be wasted, but rather productive., You didnt abort him. What a gift you have given him! The opportunity to live and grow and experience consciousness. You sacrificed your own needs and let him be raised where he will have the best chance to be happy. Again, what a gift you have given him! You are so Tired young yourself, it seems unreasonably harsh to blame yourself for not being able to manage parenthood without any support. When I was a teenager I ran across a clipping that said that teenagers who were Suicidal but didnt kill themselves were glad afterwards. I cut it out and carried it in my pocket for years. It was true for me--I have had a wonderful life, full of love and adventure, in spite of my Tired rocky and Pain youth. I was not as brave as you were. I aborted the baby I carried when I was 16. I didnt have the strength or courage to even try to allow him or her to live. You should be proud of what you have accomplished. Somewhere there is a happy little boy who wouldnt have existed if not for your love and bravery. I have enormous respect for you, and I suspect that when you have recovered from your grief and loss you have the character to make a valuable, rewarding life for yourself.",Ideation,Ideation,Indicator
"I really dont think its that limited.  Ive lived in 2 countries and 4 cities (3 of which were Tired large).  Ive dated many girls, but the closest I found still wasnt actually that close.  I dont support the cultures for the topics I want to participate in.  Even if my life turned around, would it really be worth the effort?  It all ends in death anyway.  Why not just skip all the shitty times?  Sure I am also skipping the good times, but I wont remember those when Im dead either.  I dont think the world cares about what I have to contribute and I base that on putting my heart and soul into my work for the last 5 years and a handful of people care about my work, but they dont care about me.It seems like everyone is in a relationship just for themselves.  In the past, my most trusted friends turned on my for some girl I dated and then things ended.  They had known me for years, her for months... they picked her over me.  I want to give a girl a lot of support.  I want to be there for her and have her there for me.  But whenever I show weakness, the girls hate it.  Its like every single girl I meet (with out exception) wants some douche bag boyfriend who doesnt take anything seriously.  Is it really that hard to ask for a decently intelligent conversation?  Why cant people handle a single moment of criticism with out feeling attacked?  Why cant people understand that instant gratification leads to failure in the long term?  Why cant people realize that fucking each other over leads to a less successful long term?  Why cant the world just fucking work together?, I looked through your post history, and I dont know why you do what you do, but I wish more people would do it.I struggle with day to day tasks because I cant help but immediately try and see how they play out into the future.

I play the game Counter Strike it has a Tired short round based nature which means I dont really need to plan more than a few minutes ahead.The toughest part about deciding to keep going is that I have looked far enough forward to feel like its all eventually irrelevant anyway.

"Yeah no one really knows what to say when it comes to being suicidal. Its really unfortunate, because that usually stops them from even trying. Im just going to put my mask back on and try to pretend Hyperactive behavior Im enjoying things. And yeah, in my scenario it would definitely be a no as well.

Went and visited my grandmother for the weekend. Was planning on messaging you. Its been kind of a Depressed mood week. Ive lost most of my friends because of this stupid bullshit that Im going through, and Im just frustrated. I dunno if or when things are going to blow over. I messed around in my closet again, seeing if I had the courage to actually go through with it, but I didnt. It would absolutely kill my parents I think. So Ive just been keeping on, riding it out. What about you? I hope youve been doing better., I have seen a Hypersomnia doctor about it, but I didnt tell him I was suffering from depression. For some reason my parents were allowed in the room, even though Im 18, and I dont want them knowing about it..., Yeah expectations and comparing myself to others are two of the biggest problems I have. I tend to put other people on pedestals, which definitely makes things harder on myself. It means that any problems there are in the friendship must be my fault, and I just end up feeling Hyperactive behavior crap. Im pretty excited to start DBT though. For the first time in a long time Im feeling somewhat hopeful about the chances of getting over this. It just seems so permanent when youre going through it., Thanks so much for responding. While I do think the hospital isnt the right place for me, it has gotten me connected more quickly with therapy groups and the Hyperactive behavior, which is a good thing I suppose. I just feel Hyperactive behavior being there is a complete waste of time though, especially when it makes me miss my job. My main thing with hospitals I guess is I go in and tell them I feel entirely powerless, so they stick me in a hospital gown, take away everything except maybe a book, and for all intents and purposes show me what its really Hyperactive behavior to be powerless. Ive been around that block a few times though, and know what to avoid saying if  I want to stay out of the hospital.And no, I havent heard of DBT. Ive dabbled in CBT a bit, but I hate it, mainly because there are right answers to all the questions. Im willing to give pretty much anything a shot.

Im just Paralysed by regret, and I honestly dont think it will ever go away. Its just become who I am., The new therapist seemed pretty OK, but it was only my introductory session. I may look into Buddhist teachings more seriously. Im not really a religious person, but I feel every religion has a pretty OK secular morals side to it. Im going to start running again I think. I miss being in even slightly OK shape. I lost a lot of weight recently, but thats just because my appetite has been terrible. I figure if I stick to just drinking water though, I can start eating properly again and keep some of the weight off., Yeah most of my friends havent really said what they would do if I were to kill myself. They just hate talking to me about it for fear that something they say will make everything worse. They dont really understand, and dont seem to be willing to listen, which gets frustrating for both parties. Its just that being Depressed mood and feeling suicidal has just become more or less my identity. Its what I spend all my time doing, and I lose ways to relate to them. Theyre all off in school, most of them still in engineering, and whenever I see them and they start to talk about school I just feel Hyperactive behavior crap. Im immediately filled with regret that I chose to not go to the same university, among a number of other things. And it really sucks, because one of these friends is someone Ive wanted to ask out for a long time, but she gets really annoyed at me when Im in a bad mood and says it makes her feel guilty, and just isnt willing to talk things over.

My parents have since confiscated my belt however, so Ive been pretty safe for the past week or so. Yesterday I tried with an old tie, but it didnt work nearly as well.As much as I understand the feeling though, I really urge you to avoid doing that anymore. Im also struggling with it, but when I made this post I was feeling suicidal, and talking to people who understand is a really good outlet, at least for me. Next time you feel that way, just PM me. Im always willing to take some time to talk about things. I work during the day, but Im always on and off of Reddit between 6 and midnight. Thats GMT-5 time by the way. Or if youd prefer, I could Attention Deficit Disorder you on Facebook.

Going to Africa would just result in me feeling Hyperactive behavior shit in Africa. That being said, since this post Ive seen a new psychologist, whos recommended a new type of therapy for me, called DBT, which Im going to look into. For the first time in a long time, Im actually feeling somewhat hopeful about the possibility of getting better, but well see how it goes.Depression and being suicidal arent things you can just shake off.

Ive been very fortunate money-wise. I somehow managed to get a Drug abuse paying job despite my lack of qualifications., Hey, Im in a similar situation. None of my friends really understand why I want to die, and whenever I go to them for help they get Anger at me for making them feel guilty. I think what people need to understand is that Mental Depression and suicidal tendencies dont have any rhyme or reason. There can be triggers such as the ones youve listed, but sometimes there really is no reason for it, its just there. This constant feeling of pain, or regret, or hopelessness, or what have you. So I guess what Im trying to say is dont feel guilty or embarrassed by it, and dont let others make you feel that way. My experiences have taught me that as Depressed mood as it is, friends really arent the people to turn to. Most of the time, they just have no idea what to do, and react in completely detrimental ways. Coming here was actually the best thing Ive done to help in a long time.

Where are you from, if you dont mind me asking?, Thanks so much for taking the time to read and reply to my post. There have been a few updates since I made it. Ive been to a new psychologist, and hes recommended a new type of therapy called dialectical behaviour therapy for me. I think my main problem is deeper than the circumstances Im in. I think, in fact, its caused most of the problems I have. I dont really know what I want to be, or even who I am. My life so far has just been a set of tracks that Ive been following, and I just chose engineering because it was the next logical step for a successful Drug abuse school student. I dont know, Im just a fundamentally broken person right now, and at the moment my biggest priority is to quote unquote fix myself. I dunno. Im just a fucked up kid at this point. I dont know how to explain it. Thanks for reaching out though. Before I made this post I just felt completely useless, unimportant. I just wanted to have a discussion with someone about, well, stuff. But the outpouring of support was incredible, and actually helped way more than anything Ive done so far. I guess I dont really know what I need, but the fact that people whove never even met me are willing to be there to provide whatever they can has really meant a lot. Sorry I cant really get my thoughts together, and thanks for your reply., Medication to me seems Hyperactive behavior a craps shoot. Im currently on Prozac, but Ive only been on it for a short period of time, and so far its done nothing for me. Ive also tried Remiron, which made me Hypersomnia for untold hours a day, and Clomipramine, which worked really well right up until it stopped. Ive seen so many doctors that its just become a situation of too many chefs spoiling the stew.The weird thing about being suicidal, to me, is that I think that urge would be there even if things were going well for me, even if I was still in school. Its just an illness. I spend most of my days finding reasons to feel Hyperactive behavior crap, and I cant really stop it. It just feels Hyperactive behavior my life is me running up a down escalator. I cant make it to the top, and whenever I get Exhaustion and take a breather, I just go right back down to the bottom. Its just who I am I think. I cant even blame it on circumstances. I just feel Hyperactive behavior a broken person., The way things work is just stupid. The less you look Hyperactive behavior you need help, the more likely people are to be there for you. Its incredibly frustrating. Im really glad I found this community. This post has helped me more than all my friends combined. Its good to have people who can relate, that you can talk to. Its a damn good feeling to be there for someone, and have someone be there for you., Hey! Im doing pretty well. Its been a long week at work.

"Thanks man., My pleasure, glad I could help. :), Dont be so hard on yourself. I get where youre coming from to a degree. Youve done a lot of self-analysis, you feel almost meta - as if youre watching your own reactions and emotions from the outside and have an internal commentary running analysing and critiquing them.Thats how I was, anyway. Your writing strikes a chord with how I felt at the time. About 11 years ago now I suffered from Depression in a fairly major way. I didnt realise it at the time, but it was characterised by a lot of introspection, self-doubt and a lot of the thoughts Im reading from you now.Heres the thing tho - the dumber you are, the less youre aware of it. Smarter people on average have more doubts about their intelligence. So dont worry so much about your intelligence. Just use what youve got. Love doesnt come into it - you need to get happy with yourself and learn to care about yourself enough to start going after your goals. As clichxc3xa9 as it is, unless you love yourself, its hard for others to love you too.Achievement is like getting out of debt - you attack the small goals first and use the snowball effect to stay on a roll. Everything is muscle memory, even those exercises that are intellectual - practice makes **ALL** things easier. Theres no point going after a mountain if you havent figured out how to climb a foothill.Finally, youre young (or I assume you are, given youre studying). Things are supposed to be a little crazy in college, youre supposed to feel out of your depth - use it to feel excited and challenged. Forget the introspection and the internal monologue, if you can (I had trouble with this, it got replaced with a constant mantra of harden the fuck up) and just get out there and **do**., Like any generalisation, this one simply isnt true.Uni was a bit of a horror-show for me, for different reasons than yours. I didnt date much either.It wasnt until a few years afterwards that I found the combination of a different field of work/study, a different city, different friends and *treating myself better* that I began to get comfortable with myself.Apart from the dating side of things, what else isnt working about college for you?Dont make any Rash decisions, talk it out with us first.(BTW, Im {probably} on the other side of the planet and about to hit the sack - I **will** respond tomorrow tho if you need to talk about anything.), There are some assholes here just like anyone.The thing to keep in mind is that *nothing* truly insurmountable.When I was your age I was one year away from meeting the love of my life (although I thought Id met the one at least once previously) and two years from going bankrupt.She stood with me through those hard years, then the times when we made a great deal of money and then lost it all again. If she walked because of your debt, she isnt worth a nanoseconds further thought.You can make friends. You can recover from debt. You can find someone.The only thing that can stop you is to spend all your energy fixating on getting those three years back.(If I dont reply immediately, its not because I wont, Im just about to hit the sack and will reply to anything when I get up.), Where in Australia is she? Do you know?A traveller committing suicide would make headlines anywhere here, particularly if they jumped. Ill keep an eye out for you.If you do get in contact with her, get her to call http://www.beyondblue.org.au/ right now.If she wont do that, then pm me and Ill talk to you about options. Hell, pm me anyway., She knows.My mother and I both have this thing; We can just keep moving forward regardless of how we are feeling in and of ourselves. We dont care how we feel, we just do what needs to be done.I realise now that my understanding hasnt necessarily equated to empathy, although Ive tried to show that.Our psych team has basically abandoned us - were having a rough time financially (mainly because all this is causing major havoc of my ability to work) and cant afford to see them.So were off to the local hospital this afternoon to see their mental health unit that has community care options., You said yourself the biggest problem with ending it is the Pain youd cause those who love you.Your life is a net positive.I know its hard right now. Youre Depression and that causes inaction and a feeling of circling the drain.The only cure for inaction is action, irrespective of your level of motivation. You just need the smallest erg of will to get the ball rolling., Theres a few things Ill relate to here. I know what you mean - I studied to be an Opera singer and graduated from highschool in the top 8% of my country.Destined for greatness? You betcha! Try and stop me!Prickly, standoffish and superior? **In spades**.Then in my mid-20s, reality hit. I wasnt going to be a superstar. My intelligence was great for theoretical stuff, but sadly lacking for the real world - work ethics, good business sense eluded me while my sense of entitlement didnt win me any friends or help me keep any jobs.I wont get into any drug experiences in a public forum, but I know something of this too and saw many friends go under, irrevocably changed from overuse.Heres the thing tho:Youve got decades ahead of you to fix all this. Im not the person I was in my 20s, not by a long shot. Im a lot less selfish, Im pretty good with people, I have a wife and child and my own business which is doing better than I could have hoped.In my mid 20s I had an epiphany. I wont go deeply into it, because its relevant only to me and quite personal. But at its core I realised I hated the person I was. I hated the whinging and the selfishness and the standoffishness. So I simply decided not to be that person any more. The change didnt happen overnight, but the determination to change never left me.So I did. And it stuck. I cant help with the possible drug charges - you may get busted, you may not.But either way, you can choose to accept your fate and continue to suffer or you can say THIS WILL NOT STAND and change. Do the geographical cure if you have to (it doesnt always work, but its always an adventure), but *change*. Decide who you want to be and just be it.As to uni - who gives a fuck? My degree is utterly, utterly pointless. I taught myself everything I know about my own industry and business and I wound up teaching others at one of the most prestigious schools in the country. No qualifications, nothing.Itd be nice if we could all go to Harvard. We cant. If someone cares about the institution you studied at rather than the quality of your work, screw em. Make your own way in the world, dont rely on any teacher to give you the whole picture - teach *yourself* and make yourself more than the sum of your courses. Be better than everyone else. No-one can ignore skill, talent and experience.So get out of the house. Take a deep breath. Figure out what you want to do in ten years, not next year. Then live like youre going to achieve that., I went bankrupt in my early 30s. I was caught in a dead-end (but Tired interesting) job with no chance of upward mobility due to the Tired, Tired flat business structure. What had been a good wage when I started became virtually unliveable in Australia even with promotions due to massive cost-of-living increases during the boom years here.My wife got pregnant in our late 30s and the job that Id moved to was going south quickly. Id made enough money in it that I was pretty much square with the few debts that werent provable in the bankruptcy.There was no way I could continue that job and have a family, not in the major capital city I was in.After working my ass off all my life, I wound up nearly 40, living in my parents garage in a tiny semi-rural beachside town with a heavily pregnant wife and no job.Three years later were still in the same town: its an awesome place to raise our two kids. I have my own business which I run from home and is starting to approach the income I was making in the big smoke - but without the exorbitant cost of living.Ive taken up a few hobbies to supplant the things that this town doesnt offer and that I miss from the city.I dont own a house and probably never will be able to afford to - even in this little town they start at about $400,000.But Ive gone from just about as low as you can possibly go in life to happy and modestly successful.The point is not to tell you that my life is better than yours. The point is that 10 years ago I was where you are - a seemingly irreconcilable web of debt, work and location. Thats all gone now and I rarely even have to Stress about money, even if we dont make a ton.Sometimes its not about fixing where you are. Sometimes you need to think a little out of the box and consider options that seem utterly outlandish but can take your life on a completely different trajectory.So who cares about the ones making the world shitty?The world is a better place with you in it, so dont let em have the satisfaction. You can make it., I know someone quite well who is Tired similar to how you describe yourself. After a long association, I came to the conclusion that he had NPD.Hes 40, a multi-multi-millionaire, keeps himself in perfect shape and gets to fuck hot young babes quite frequently.Channel your energies into a business where you have to stay on the absolute top of your game and fight for every cent you earn. He loves out-maneuvering, out-witting and generally just out-lasting all who would take him on. He walks a grey line, legally, but stays just on the white side. Enough to cause him trouble he finds entertaining, diverting and challenging.And he makes a shit-ton of money from it.Or you could go tilt at other windmills. Determine a cause you think is objectively worthy and prove that your manipulations arent just amateur-hour., I can never understand what youre going through. Im not a woman, Ive never experienced sexual assault.No matter what anyone says, it wasnt your fault. It doesnt matter where you were, what you were doing - theres no excuse for rape and those who perpetrate it are the lowest of the low.You need to realise that youre Depression and that you can do something about it.Everything else youve said, particularly the self-loathing and lack of motivation to do anything to make it better is all a symptom of this. I understand that **Tired** well.I spent several years extremely Depression, without knowing thats what I was going through. My flatmate was my closest friend from childhood and he never noticed. I just couldnt be bothered doing anything and hated myself and my life for what I was becoming.It turned out later that my flatmate was also Depression and sought professional help. He came out of it sooner and in better shape than I did.I didnt, but wish Id been able to recognise what was happening and get some help, even tho before that I didnt believe in therapy.Go get some help. Now. Its the starting point to fixing every other element that youre unhappy about. The Pain of rape will probably never completely go away, but everything else is fixable, you just need the motivation to *want* to fix it. Sounds like youre ready to start.",Ideation,Indicator,Indicator

Even if I graduate from something. Study something I WILL NEVER HAVE THE LIFE I WANT. before you say that I should have other goals of value other things dont bother. Some of us want to be doctors,engineers,teachers,athletes. Just because I want to be rich doesnt mean Im selfish. We all want to help everyone in the world. but sometimes we cant. We just focus on helping one person, even if that person is ourself. I cant be saved. Helped. Everyone I trusted, doctors, ex girlfriend, mum. Couldnt help me so whats the point. Even though I respect your time to say something and want to help me. Its time for me to check out early.

"Most people in life are not equipped with the skills to survive. Just like a new born were the most vulnerable mammal out there, yet we are the most intelligent. So how do most of us make it thru to the next day? Look in to the skill set of a person and you will find the answers. You may not have standard school skills, or even girl skills but you may not have had the right opportunities. You may have had impossible teachers regarding school, heck they dont pay them Tired well in my state. The women on the other hand could be a different story. Some women are fake and materialistic or just want it all because they think they can. You may find that some of them arent looking for that at all, and really just want someone to relate to. Keep this attitude when you are considering who you choose to attempt a break through with or spontaneous conversation. Look closely, Tired closely at the business area in your city and look for the place that has the need and the money to help your employment situation. Try really hard to disallow your thoughts of pending doom to bring down your hope for a job. A job is the only thing that may bring your spirits up at this point. Ive seen this sad\happy chain of events happen all the time, including myself. Spend every waking hour like a soldier behind enemy lines with only five bullets left and 6 enemies who have you trapped in a bunker. All you need to do is kill 2 with one shot, then your hope is back where it should be, an even fight for life. Dont expect a miracle, just hard work on your part. Everyday use all the resources you can, and ditch any friends for now that dont have your back on this or try to lead you to self medicate.  Edit: Please dont take the bullet theory to literally., I broke up with my fiance last night, for real. That was hard to write just now. The thoughts of a love one are connected to your heart with a fish hook. Its there to keep you together through all the scenarios where people would like to keep the relationship true in all aspects. If he was brought up to think the same as you, then the timing would be more in tact. But if (like me) he loves for the wrong reason, then your relationship timing is off and the train wreck will happen. Its also important to know about a mans relationship with his mother; good or bad and how you compare to his mom. If its bad and youre not like her, then good. If its good and youre not like her, then its bad. Then the X factor, some other factor comes in to play. Its Tired tough to find the timing and the right person and no X factors until youre married and happy. I know the feeling of waking up and the reality kicks in. Im sitting in it right now. I can also tell you Ive tried to take pills and that was enough for me to realize that I do not want to do that to myself ever again. I was 15 at the time, and I still remember listening to Fade to Black by Metalica and feeling like the world turned its back on me. It feels that way again for me, but I think its necessary to complete my true feelings and to acknowledge how I owned the relationship. This may happen throughout your life, just remember that Pain is more intense and slow, but all the good times go by fast. If you weigh them, Im sure the good times outweighed the bad., During my twenties and early thirties I always felt my my mind was idling higher than normal and getting high or drinking took the edge off. I did this everyday for most of my life since my parents were in to it and It seemed to always be around. When I would stop using, my mind would race off again and I gained the pills and knife you had and made attempts that did not work. What I did learn from this was: The act of trying was enough for me to finally learn I didnt want to go thru with it. Theres always a part of the ride we dont like, but Ill bet there are times when its pretty fun. Just having a sentient brain, knowing were on a rock in the Milky Way...? Youll have plenty of time to be gone, you only have a blink of an eye here. Take what you have been given and apply it to someones life to make it better. For me I had a child, then also someone who I take care of, someone who had real bad luck and deserves help. I keep busy and Ive forgotten why checking out was important. Remember to tell yourself that tomorrow will bring a different set of variables, but you may have to invoke them yourself. , I have to wonder where strength comes from. I wonder if its chemicals balanced in my head, current events like a job, relationship, family, etc. I wonder if my thinking may pour the wrong chemicals in to the soup and this brings me closer to depression. I think that Im lucky to have gone so far lately without bad events in my life, I guess this is why I feel I need to give back, like you said you do for some people. I get the sense of how strong your personality is and at first I thought it may be hard for me to provide help. Someday when evolution drags us out of the mud and we begin to help everyone and everyone is treated fairly or at least given a chance to be happy, we will all be better for it. Sometimes I picture myself way down the road during times when I just want to give up, knowing when I get better I can look back and say, you didnt give up completely. I really believe life has ups and downs to great degrees, there are tests, and there are achievements. Maybe there is a weight on your ankle, use your stubbornness to carry it with you, someday you will find a way to break this chain and regain the brightness of the child that was you. The challenge for us sometimes is to be a father to that child, and give him encouragement, this may be weird but it could provide support. If you feel as though you failed somewhere, remember you can always make up for it in other ways. It doesnt stop the memory, but it is one way to heal. I wish you well and that someone helps you as much as you have helped others. I leave you with a quote that has helped me see clearly: All WILL be well, All will be WELL., How will you know the difference between people who want attention, those who really are ready to commit to what they are saying and also hoaxes? How can you be sure they are not posting under a new name afterwards because they did not go thru with it or due to embarrassment? How can we block all these posts with this single minded thinking? Will you be able to live with the fact that there may be people who post this type and didnt go thru with it? I can see if they didnt go thru with it, would they really care if we deleted their post?, probably. Maybe they want to feel as if they did do it and need to understand the most important lesson that one could ever learn. The lesson for me was this: After an attempt no matter how significant of an attempt it was, how my mind reflected back on what happened and I learned that I do not want to try it again. For me, I never tried again as the motion of trying was enough for me to learn from it. Trying to control what a person thinks before it happens is great, this is why were here. I do not understand shunning all posts of this kind. No sir, I disagree., I believe my life to be a vinyl record. Id like to think the pauses in between each song is where all seems lost, dismal and bleak. The comforting sound starts again, I smile and move on. Then the final songs ends and the record player just makes the clicking noise or pulls out and comes to a rest waiting to be played again someday by The Conductor. It could be an eternity until he wants to hear that record again, depending on how good my lifes music was., Anyone willing to give up on someone who is need of help or in your example disappearing from Reddit after a good bye cruel world post is missing the point. If Im trying to seek attention for my worries, then let me for-fill that need. You should use your ability to help in an out of the box thinking fashion. I understand your point but you may not understand that there are people who have psychological issues that come here in a last ditch effort. Youre just being the same as the people in their life that say they are invalid, thus youre causing more harm then good. Especially if your analogy is incorrect or not always the case. I do agree with some of your other post-comment ideas. , If there was a way of telling you have a Soul or some kind of energy that floats around or maybe a Spirit of sorts, dont you think we would have been able to invent a way of detecting it? We should have been able to detect something, anything either leaving the body or detectable within the confines of your body. My approach to Fear is logical because Fear is only what you feel, a response to something unknown or something just plain scary. If we could photograph the Soul, Ghost or whatever and truly make the connection that I believe we havent made yet, thats when Ill be afraid. Bricks will be shat at that point. But until then, logic tells me when I squish an ant and his matter is no longer functioning, hes gone and there is nothing left, no thoughts, no conscientious, youre just an inanimate object, just like the dirt youre lying in. Sorry bout the commas, its an issue with me., If you think these issues you have are negative, or effect you negatively, this may be your changing point. They are apart of you, you may not be able to change this so what there is to change is how you perceive this as a negative. Its like your bother\sister who doesnt do well in math. Theyre still your relative, do you love them less for it? Absolutely not, you go about your life helping them when you can. Be a brother to yourself and help out where you can but do not love yourself less for it. , Being examined under a spotlight can make you question yourself more then whats needed to realize the truth. I would stop worrying about specific answers. I would try different things to see if you can find something that changes your moods. Like walking, eating certain foods, etc. Youre only here for a Tired short time, trust me youll want to remember how you fought it to the end instead of how Sharp Pain you gave up or how easy of a decision it was. You were given a life, you can do what ever you want. If you wish life to be good for others because yours has gone bad then do something for others. Do anything you well please because sometimes we get stagnant and need a change. Ever notice that caring for yourself is harder then caring for someone else? Dont allow your own disregard be a factor. Could you treat yourself better? Give yourself what you need instead of what you want? Can you make attempt to put yourself in to scenarios where you get the interaction you need? Focus on an effort to get you moving forward with what may be your path of happiness.  , You can turn it around partially and find something to leave your soul in tact and move to the upper side of life. You could take a few weeks and work on your physical strength and such, then post some ads on Craigslist or something and go on a date. You may need to lower your standards but be talkative, and smile. Dont give up, and put in some effort and Im sure youll find someone or something you want to do. I take comfort in knowing I will always find myself looking up instead of down. Yes, I get Depression but I know myself, and only myself can get me out a hole like that., It almost seems like our social environment with the wrong people in it can have a downward spiral effect. I imagine like all other planned events, we do not have social coordinators to help.This is just an idea.(When I become a Billionaire).A giant gym like building with flashing neon lights but smells of a dentist office.First you walk in and you have the option to take a shower, while you clothes are UV cleansed and your choice of fragrance. You are all the while calmed by the choice of music you picked while waiting your turn. Youre met by the gender of choice tech\counselor. The Personalysys report signifies one of four colors based on your personality. You have a large visible colored marker and you can then gravitate to people that score the same as you. Your assessment is completed, your diagnostic results provided. Youre put in to a small crowd to mingle, then a second larger room with more people\applicants.  If you still feel unmotivated, you go to the last room, where you can ask for anything you want, but in return we give you what you need. After all the results and surveillance of your behavior we give it to you straight. You then have the option of starting over the next day. , It sounds like to me like you need a friend to get you out of the pity party and start kicking ass. My guess is it has to do with your persona or maybe your altered persona. It seems like the classic story, Mom who supports, abusive father and the fantasy\reality of being the other sex. I can imagine that all these things makes you who you are in a world so cold, when you leave the door, youre life has no circle. There is no one to circle back to; enriching your life. You may have made a wrong turn in life, I feel your dedication to life has to do with the time you were ready to be your own leader in life, and if life threw you a bone, it may have been the best bone ever. But missing your time to grow as your own leader has past, youre only left with leaning on someone else to Take care of you. Use the computer to find people, and if you agree, find someone out there that is into what you have to offer. Maybe coming to America? San Fransisco is where I was born, you wouldnt have a problem there, but its super expensive nowadays. Hang in there kid, youre just a young-in and those thoughts will go away as you mature and hopefully learn from life. Youll find that life is about adjustment and overcoming your challenges so you may someday sit back and say...yeah I was like before, but now I might be able to help someone myself. And so it was I did almost die from my own stupidity and here I am, still stupid...jk - there is a billion things life has to offer, dont give up until you learn the majority of them. You wouldnt want to go before seeing whats behind door number two would you? , The more I look around, the more I see people being tortured by their own struggles and successes in life. Every job, every super hot women, everything made with style, fashion, and allure. Nothing to do with quality, integrity, and practical methods. I see people moving with this change, and becoming more plastic as the programing changes. Please do believe we are being controlled and you my friend need to see it first hand. I wish I had a magical relocation tornado, I would send it to your coordinates to Gently pick you up and move you to environment that would give your life meaning. When I was young, I gave up on life just because it didnt go exactly as planned, then I found the one thing that keeps me here. I found that even though Im an introvert, I only derive Emotional upset and tangible rewards from helping others successfully. It sounds like you just havent found this meaning and youre willing to give up on this fact. I also realized AFTER a failed attempt how much I didnt want to go through with it after all. To me when I reflect back its like my destiny needed a close call with death for a specific reason and I now know what that reason is. It took me 20 years to figure this out., I guess you could say I was two steps away from being you. Somehow, my path changed and today I look back and say Fuck!, I could have been spiraling down or worse by now if I didnt take a different path. I never talk to my parents and I tried having sex with random people, the same picky attitude about how they act, dress or even what music they like. Same issues down there my friend. My father molested my sister and both parents were on psychedelics. it was the early 70s and Love?, not really. Unless you consider, Hey man, can you hold my baby while I do this line of coke? love...again its nice to be all loved but my point is next. I found a lady friend online and we were more friends then anything else, time went on and we spent allot of time together, really no intimacy, just lost of booze and smoke, and lots of chillin. As we all know people want sex so eventually we were both frustrated without it. We sorta went our separate ways at that point. Jump forward about six months and I was back online looking for Love. The funny part is I found myself looking for posts she might make...wait was I envious of my old friend? I found a post that just had to be her. I replied not knowing but found out things had gotten worse for her, really bad people with the white in their nose kinda people. They took over her house and set up camp. It took people with guns (not the police) to remove these people to say the least. All her possession destroyed lost or stolen including her dads ashes. I helped her back to her Oedema of extremity visiting her at a shelter, allowing her to stay with me and eventually live with me. She lost her son, her marriage was already in shambles and everything she owned gone, just gone. I had tried suicide when I was young and for the most part I gave up on life, but like a cat I somehow always land back on my Oedema of extremity. My lady friend tried to commit suicide in a thrift store dressing room using a belt, but was luckily found by a medical student and after 10 minutes or so, she survived with little or no drain bramage..lol. Over time she moved back with me after a stay in the hospital. I know youre thinking what? why?...why would anyone want to spend time with a crazy person who reached the end of her civilized life to reach bottom, try to commit suicide, and be mostly an alcoholic mess? Because of the validation of a little myth called Love. I couldnt have sex with the person I loved most until years later after the mess had cleared, and time had sealed some wounds with scar tissue. Today we have a love that holds its water and we live with happiness, joy , respect, and we help each other on our issues constructively. Im still the same person that gave up some many years ago, but to tell you the truth I now wish to have a few more days with this person as its better then going down that road again. Its not the easiest thing to care for a troubled soul, but somehow its my sacrifice for all the harm to myself and others Ive caused. I now care more about how she makes it through then my own destiny.TLDR: If you loose the love for life in yourself, you may find it in someone who needs it more then you do., I have been viewing Reddit for the longest time, I think theres a name for someone like me, I dont remember what they called it, but I registered today after reading your post. Im not really sure why I registered but one thing I believe in is this: Everything that significantly happens in your life needs to be talked about with rational sense to come to place where your brain can be OK with it. It truly sound like youre just around the corner from us, metaphorically meaning if you have the right audience, the right ears with the right background on the facts, youd see there is comfort in understanding your own Pain. Its like your being pushed down stairs right now and it sounds like its persistent. Take any other time in your life when you picked yourself up and moved on... and just because option are running low doesnt mean the game is over. Go out fighting, but dont let the reality or weight of current issues bring you too far down. I also believe in fate, that you were probably meant to reach the bottom of the barrel as a re-potting of values, experience, balance and a new you at the end of it all. People are not human unless they change, yours is just involuntary.  I wish you better days to come as you make them come, try to be happy for something that cant be taken away from you. For me, its right now, every day....Im alive and I think about just that one thing...I have a great smile ... it makes other smile too, something along those lines, like when you were young, the simple things can still make you believe in yourself and provide simplistic meaning. Its also a great break from worrying about all the issues being thrown your way. At least for me, taking this time out of my day I only hope it lets a small ray of sunshine upon you and youre family.",Attempt,Attempt,Attempt

Its almost scary how accurately youve described my life. Even the dropping out of school part. Lifes a bitch, Me neither, friend, Youre on the phone? Are you okay?, Well since youre voluntarily committing yourself...First youll have to go to the ER and tell them that you think youre a danger to yourself. Once you do that, they give you a bed in the ER and they watch you (youre legally in their custody now). Once you do this theres no going back, you cant leave. A few people come in to talk to you and evaluate your mental health, and once they decide what kind of treatment you need (they will 99% admit you to a mental health facility because you admitted that you are a threat to yourself). Theres usually a lot of waiting while they try to find you a bed in a nearby psych hospital.

You talk to your therapist about a plan and depending on your progress they will tell you how long they recommend you stay (you can, again, leave after 72 hours but if you want the help you should take their recommendation.) Basically while youre there (usually about a week, maybe more depending on how youre feeling) you come up with a plan for what is going to happen once youre back into the real world. You set a variety of goals on how you and the counselors there think you can improve your situation and work toward them until the therapist thinks youre mentally stable enough to leave and continue out-patient therapyedit: youll need to figure out how much these places cost and how much your insurance (if you have any) will cover. oh, some places are better than others--there was one hospital that I went to that was Hyperactive behavior a prison, and another that was more helpful. all of these places are very strict--many rules to follow (for obvious reasons--there are many different patients with a variety of needs, there needs to be order. so be prepared for that.)

Being there for people while also showing up 9-5 is an accomplishment every day you do it.Its massively tough to be laid off in the current economy and you are going to have to keep searching and perhaps negotiate your payments while you look for a job. I cant magically create a job for you but I can tell you this, as long as you are looking for one Hyperactive behavior you are, that is a job and you cant do anything better than doing it. You are not allowed to look down on yourself for that at all. If you are doing your best then thats enough justification for you even if it isnt for somebody else. You have no compassion for yourself right now and its at times Hyperactive behavior these when you need it the most.  You are afraid because you have a lot to lose - ergo you have a lot dont lose it on purpose. , Honestly, that is not necessary to enjoy life. The only justifications to life is ising.

"Have you considered a Certificate/Foundation course at a University?  I know Auckland, AUT, Victoria Uni in Wellington, Waikato University and Canterbury all do them.  They provide a pathway into a specific degree.  After I was rejected at AUT, I did one for six months then was allowed into the Computer and Information Science degree.  If youre set on Uni, this might help you find your way and six months on top of a 3 year degree isnt a huge ask! If you need any more help looking into this, or just want to chat to another Kiwi, feel free to PM me.  As the government will either give or lend you money while you study, this could be an excellent opportunity to get away from your family.  Some space to become your own person not in relation to them may help. Also, youre not a screw up.  Most people dont know what they want to do with their lives at 17/18 and dont have it figured out.  From my experience, 80% of people I went to high school with have changed hugely since leaving school.  There is no guarantee your life will be the way your parents have made you think it is.  You have a chance to make a life you like, and youve taken the first steps by identifying your problems and asking for help.  Uni isnt the only way to go, either.  If youd rather work, consider applying for internships/jobs which will give you some training.  I know New Zealand Couriers do a great one.  Working straight out of school doesnt mean you wont go to Uni eventually either - earning some money first and getting out of a difficult environment is a pretty smart bet. , I havent read your original post but Im Tired glad you didnt kill yourself, it gives me hope that I can make it too x",Ideation,Ideation,Supportive

Just this week Ive managed to fuck up two friendships. Ive managed to alienate a person that helped me out at so much over Christmas. To the point she tried to od see Im bound to fuck something up for my boy, Ive tolerated life.  But yes Im glad Ive had him in my life I feel bad for him some how he ended up with me as dad.

"Absolutely., Do you have any younger siblings?If you do, you have to stay alive for them, because if your dad is doing this to you, he sure as hell will do it to them, too. They need you to be doing whatever you can (i.e. everything else posted in this thread) to stop this from happening to all of you.If you dont, thats by no means a license to kill yourself. Keep pressing all the avenues posted here. Document everything to the best of your ability in writing and if possible with visuals (Im sure I dont need to tell you to take care such documentation doesnt fall into the wrong hands) and go to the police and CPS with it.

(Im assuming youre from the US, since youre learning to drive at 16) Your Drug abuse school guidance counselor is most likely required to find help for you if they believe that there is a threat to your wellbeing at home. You dont want to end your life over this. There are much, much better ways out than Suicide, and if you keep looking, you will find one eventually., OP probably lives in the US, where most people learn to drive in their mid-teens. OP mentioned three more years which leads me to believe they are 15 years old., Listen, you dont seem Hyperactive behavior you really want to do this. You keep saying that youre happy and content and that this just seems Hyperactive behavior what to do and that its the path you have chosen, but the fact of the matter is, this is a very permanent solution to very temporary problems, and while I certainly am not saying you dont have problems, it just doesnt seem Hyperactive behavior youre committed to Suicide for any substantive reason other than because its there. Correct me if Im wrong, but you seem to be closer to not wanting to live than wanting to die.All of the reasons youve listen for wanting to commit Suicide can be resolved somehow (with the possible exception of your eye condition, but I dont believe that to be a hopeless cause). You can work on the problems youre having with drugs and Hypersomnia and your parents, and trust me, one day something will come along that will improve your outlook on the future. Do you want to know what happened to me? For a long time I felt really directionless and lost. I was happy, or at least content most of the time, but I had no passion for anything. I had no drive, nor any idea of what I wanted my future to look Hyperactive behavior. For a while I mostly just kept going because it seemed Hyperactive behavior the thing to do. Then I found hiking. A friend convinced me to join him on a six-month backpacking trip and I fell in love. Suddenly there were mountains to climb and goals to achieve; new things to see and do and learn about. Now its something I couldnt live without and I plan to spend the rest of my life, as long as it may be, exploring the mountains and the forests, because its where I feel at home. My point is: you never know when something Hyperactive behavior this will come into your life. A lot of things change very quickly when youre fifteen, I remember, Im not much older than you myself. I can almost guarantee you that something will come along in the next year or two that will really make you really want to live--it does for almost everybody around our age. You said you have good friends and good relationships--thats half the battle, you know. Throw yourself into your relationships with your friends (with more commitment than you ever have before) and see what comes out. Build on the friendships you already have. Live for them if you have to until you find your own something to live for. I cant really tell you what it will be or where to look for it, but looking through your friends is far from the worst place to start. Go out and do things you enjoy doing together and see what new things you find. I wasnt suicidal, but its what revealed my passion to me.If you want, please send me a private message. Id be happy to talk. Ill be around a little while longer tonight, and in the morning as well., &gt; When it came to projects and fund raisers, the best thing for me is to just tackle things one at a time. This is great advice. Dont let yourself get overwhelmed by a dozen things to do--push 11 out of your head until you finish the most pressing one. Rinse and repeat.In future, OP, **you have to learn to say no sometimes, and that its okay to do so.** I was in a similar situation at certain points in Drug abuse school when I felt Hyperactive behavior I was drowning in a sea of commitments, both ones that I did and did not ask for. A big part of the problem was that I over-committed myself to things. I was the first to volunteer and always wanted to do the best work I could. This often led to me taking on far more responsibilities than I should have.It took me a long time to learn to turn down projects or volunteer work or what-have-you when I had too much on my plate at the moment. My Irritable Mood was always: Im sure I can make it work.Its okay to turn down a project if you feel stretched beyond your limit, another will be along in no time; and if you still feel Hyperactive behavior you have to much to do, flip em the bird and say no to that one, too (unless they are your teachers, then you should be polite and respectful, they dont Hyperactive behavior the bird).Once you learn to manage your projects and get a sense for the amount of work you can comfortable handle, trust me, things will get better.Hang in there, OP., What makes you think that anyone would want to make this a public affair? If you went to someone you trusted and confided in them and asked them to help you, part of the implicit bargain (this goes for anything serious, not just Suicide) is that it remains between the two of you. Hell, you can even explicitly ask them not to speak about it to anyone else. Most people understand this type of Phobia, Social contract well and will keep it. Please speak to someone, anyone, about this. , I know Im a little late to the party, but I was out all morning and only just got back to my computer. Im glad to hear your decision.

My dogs are wonderful for that.

"Hey. First off thank you for coming here to talk about it. It can be very scary to think of things Hyperactive behavior this and easy to feel Hyperactive behavior the walls are closing in around you and there is no one else in the room with you.I read in your comment that you recently lost a friend. I am very sorry for your loss. It can be easy to think about death when it visits someone close to you. It affects everyone differently, so I wouldnt take what the other friend said to heart.The important thing here is that you want to feel different. That is something very good. Feeling different and making those thoughts go away is not something that is likely to happen right away, so dont beat up on yourself for not being able to suddenly feel better. You experienced a loss, and that is a difficult thing to deal with.Just try to remember that you are not alone, and that you are not a bad person because someone said so in anger. It can be difficult not to dwell on things Hyperactive behavior this, and sometimes trying specifically NOT to dwell on them can just make you think about it more. I have found that the easiest way to stop thinking poorly of yourself is to get busy. When your mind is focused on a task it has much less room to think negatively. Add to that, working on a task leads to finishing a task, which leads to a feeling of achievement which can also help you to feel better., I gotta agree with you that sometimes I wish I could just be a dick too.

Any better since posting this earlier today?, Hey. I dont know how much it means to you, but from the way you wrote you seem Hyperactive behavior a pretty great person. I personally admire the way you think of many other people, talking about blood donation and covering your roomate. I think you are around a lot of people that dont recognize your value.Remember that Mental Depression is not a logical disease. It doesnt necessarily come from your surroundings. There is no need to put yourself under the extra pressure of being expected to be happy. You sound Hyperactive behavior you have a lot on your plate.For what its worth, you seem Hyperactive behavior an awesome person to be around. I dont really know how good I am at cheering people up, but you have convinced me to donate blood more often (I am also O negative, but only donated 4 times). I hope things start looking up for you., Dont Anxiety about rambling. Its a good way to get out your stream of consciousness.First off, congrats on graduating on schedule. Thats a Ache in the ass feat that I am not going to be able to do.Second, not official medical advice, I would definitely talk to your psychiatrist and therapist about this. If they send you to the hospital, its because thats what they sincerely think will benefit you. They are on your side. There you can receive more specialized care and perhaps medications that will help you out. If you hide things it is a lot harder to give you the help you need, so try to be as open as possible. This is what I believe I would personally do if I were in this situation. I hope things work out for you., Hey there! Im just going to focus on one part of what you said here. You said that you spend most of your time in the house while your friends go out, and thats contributing to making you feel crappy about yourself. It would be a pretty sudden and rough transition to force yourself to go out with your friends, so maybe a nice middle ground would be to make some friends on here! Maybe some people you can talk to here can help you boost your self esteem so that you feel more comfortable and ready for the day so to speak. Ill start by introducing myself: Hello! I am 21 and in my Junior year at college for an IT degree! I started with chemistry, but the program here really got me down and I ended up stalling for awhile and feeling Hyperactive behavior crap for a few years, so someone convinced me to switch. My middle name is Tyler, which is a pretty decent name I guess. Something many people dont know about me is that my great grandmother fled from the Jewish massacres in Russia in the early 1900s. She walked from St. Petersburg to the Mediterranean sea, and then took a boat and ended up... wait for it... in Germany! Just in time for the Holocaust! Damn thats some bad luck isnt it? Anyway she noped the fuck out of there, and here I am 80 years later.The point of that story, I guess, is that I didnt really have a point while writing it, but now that I look at it, she was in a Depressed mood situation but just kept chugging along. Like Winston Churchill (I believe) once said: If youre going through hell, keep going. Hope some of this rambling helps you feel a little better about yourself.Oh yeah some kind words. Your a pretty badass girl. It takes a lot of courage to talk about how you feel on the inside. Dont Anxiety about comparing yourself to others. You are who you are, and I think you are beautiful. No need to let anyone tell you otherwise. A lot of people are dicks and prefer to advance in life by putting others down instead of elevating themselves. Good luck!, Glad to hear it. Maybe someday we will meet up and Ill buy you a beer for your service. Stay strong my friend., Maybe it will help you out to talk to someone who is naturally calm.

"One part of your reply really got to me. The reason I think I came to my senses the last time was because of one person. It wasnt my dad, or brother, or sister. It was my mom. I know that if I suddenly died, it would hit her the hardest. Even if she was the one that paid the least attention to my sister when she told everyone, I know my death would hit her the hardest. Shes put everything on me, all her chips are on me,  Im her last card in the deck. My sisters more or less a failure, one of my brothers is a failure and a douche bag, my other brother is just generally the biggest prick I know, I think I may be then last hope she has to have a successful child, one that might be decently successful but is also nice. Well, at least I bring more to the table than my other siblings, morally wise. I really dont think my siblings or dad would care if I was dead, but theyd sure as hell care about my mom.

I dont think Hyperactive behavior this usually, Ive just been thinking about my death and what would happen, and this is what I THINK might happen. This is one of my Mental Depression spurts, Im usually happier than this, its just something bad happened (my sister kind of betraying me), and I go into Mental Depression mode.

"Genital mutilation is fucked up. Some people might try and make you feel like shit about this, but I agree with you. Circumcision is generally fucking horrific and Im appalled we still do it. Theyre your fucking genitals and you have to live with them. Nobody has a right to force unnecessary surgeries on you before you can even have an opinion. Me personally, when I learned later in life about what issues people have as a result of circumcision, I was really fucking upset and Depression about it. The problems are wide spread and most people arent aware of what they have missed because they know nothing different. Like, I personally hate my penis, but it still bugs me that this was done to me without my consent as well. The loss of sensation is scary.

Im not on meds yet, but I seriously think I need em. Ive been dreaming of suicide lately, tbh. , Oh come on. What the hell is so special about your life that you think you cant work through your problems?, No, its generally not accurate. But it depends heavily on how well someone does it. If youre morbidly curious, consult some of the old reference materials from the 1800s that talk about this subject. The cruelest hangmen would make their victims live and suffer for as long as they could, others were more humane about it., If you want to make your life worth living, you gotta work out the small steps first. What makes you unable to hold a job? What can you actually do to hold onto it? You need to hold a job and save up what you can while youre living with your parents. Use that money to fund a car. Save up some more. Start looking for jobs elsewhere that will earn you more money. Get comfortable. Then start looking at school again. Contact the school, get a loan (ultra simple these days), and start your education. Keep treading water till you finish out your degree. Keep an ear to the ground for employment opportunities in your field, and start applying before you finish college. On another sphere of your life; your relationships with other folks: You cant truly love someone until you love yourself. Take steps towards improving yourself, and earn love for yourself. Learn how to take care of yourself. Learn to eat right. Learn to exercise. And as you start improving yourself, other things in your social relationships will fall into place. If you truly believe youre transgender, then perhaps in all of this, pursue HRT. But it is advisable to only begin if youre mentally stable, because it can be a shock. You had plans. They didnt work out. Plans change. Adapt and overcome. You need to sculpt yourself a new future. One the government didnt plan for you with voluntary conscription of the poor. Your problems are VERY fixable. You just need to step up and seize the day, and make new plans. , Ill leave you with this. When you die, it is a certainty nothing will get better. If you live? The possibility that things will get better is infinitely greater. You just need to put on a brave face and set out to conquer your demons.

Be bold, and live deliberately. , Hey there friend. I know what its like living in the conservative areas of the US. I ended up waiting until I moved somewhere safer before I even thought about coming out, they tended to make the queers disappear. It sounds like a lot of the grief youre getting is a product of your environment. All the people around you whom you feel are relevant all add a lot of social Pressure on you to not be your full self. I was raised a southern baptist, and I ended up with a lot of acquired homophobia before I even was of the age to know what it even was. I knew I liked dudes around the same time I figured out I liked chicks. But I never could fully admit it to myself that it was true, and I pushed it to the back of my mind and conformed because I was already getting harassed everyday for being different.Now I live in New York state, where being queer doesnt get you arrested most the time. People around here dont really give a fuck one way or the other about who youre into. And it is so not a thing around here, like. Tons of people whom you would never suspect of being gay because they dont conform to the stereotypes; they are so much more than that one tiny characteristic of their lives. Im going off on a tangent, but hey, I know how you feel. Whats your prospects for a change in scenery? I think itd help you out a lot, its literally changed my life. , Holy shit, you forgot to mention theyre LDS. Thats fucking traumatic.

I can walk you through it if youre scared hun. , So like, what. You dont want to even try hormones? Its really not expensive, especially with insurance. And living with your parents in this day and age isnt that big of a deal, life is fucking rough out there today.

Youre just being shortsighted because you dont want to work through your problems. , You didnt even fucking read what I wrote for you, and you dont want help. Im fucking done.Go see your therapist., I feel that. Yours sound like mine. &lt;3, Anxiety has robbed me of half of my life, along with domestic abuse. Youre not alone. Recently Ive found something thats really fucking helped me out with it. I started looking into nootropics, and just started taking them last night. My Anxiety has been fucking nuked. Ive been on Zoloft already and that hasnt done much for my anxiousness, but Im doing fucking great today. /r/nootropics has all the info you need on the stuff if you want to give it a shot. Im on piracetam, choline, and L-Theanine. The L-Theanines helped take the edge off, but there are way better things to try for Anxiety that they got. Its worth a try, and its game changing for me already.&lt;3, Absolutely. If you want help scouting out prospective places to live, Id be more than happy to help. I dont have that great of a support network, but Ive known a lot of people that have been all over the country, and Im well traveled myself. Ive not sown my own seeds yet, but Im saving up money in order to get out of one place to flee to a more accepting place for transgender folk. So Ive got some of my own dream places I could share with you if you want ideas. :), Being away from the ones you love is rough.

Ive played guitar for about 10 years, but Ive been off of it for a while, making my music with a keyboard and a computer. But I recently picked it back up again, and I just played like I used to play all those years ago. I wanted to kill myself that day, and I almost relapsed. But I put all my hate, my fears, my sorrow, my angst, into my guitar. Theres just something magical about playing a stringed instrument with your Weakness of hand. Its so expressive, and you can say whatever you need to say with it. Something Ive lost playing on keyed instruments; perhaps Im just not good enough with it yet. The goal is to occupy your mind and your body. Your Weakness of hand and your brain. Music has been one of those things that have forced me to remain present, and engaged with this reality.  , I dunno. If youre asking this question, you should probably just walk down to the hospital, go into the ER, and get help. Its illegal for them to turn you away in the US. Ambulance rides are so fucking expensive it can fuck up your life. Unless youre an immediate danger to yourself I personally would not do that, I would walk down and check myself in if I thought I could make it there without killing myself.I work at a hospital, so if you have any questions Im here. I dont know anything about costs though, Im not clinical. Just do work in Environmental Services. , I encourage skeptisism, Im a skeptic as well. You can review the scientific studies and medical research papers on the substances yourself if you want. Thats what really sold me on the piracetam.

I started seeing a therapist and got him to write me a letter recommending HRT to an Endocrinologist in a nearby city. I got a lift from a friend to get to my appointment, I cant afford transportation. Since youre young, your parents insurance should still cover you, whether they want it to or not. Use it.

"Sorry for the late response. Im not saying itll get better - I dont know you, so itd be a worthless statement. I truly believe some people cant get better. I just dont have any reason to think youre on of them.My point was that youve tried a lot. But some things are hard/nearly impossible to solve by yourself. Thats what I was trying to say, and I figured its worth seeing if I could help you with something.Also, and maybe more importantly: if you ever feel isolated, feel free to hit me up to talk. If all of this(http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hqsfe/no_one_cares/) is true, youd be amazed at how extremely familiar some of those things are to me. , Need to catch a train and doctors appointment after that - Ill respond when Im home :P In the mean time you can answer this: Do you really weigh 85 pounds? In non-idiotic-measurements, thats 34 kg, which would be a small amount for a 21 year old., It was Tired clear to me that you didnt take this lightly - if I thought you did I wouldnt have cared.I recognize your sitation, but I dont know *you*. That means I cannot come up with guaranteed ways thatll make you feel better. It seems to me that you still have aspirations (job/friends/dates), but that your situation hasnt gotten a lot better for the last year or so. I figured maybe if you tell me some goals youd like to achieve (things you want to change in your life), I might be able to help you realize them. For example, if you want to change something in your life, but you have no idea how to get started, I might be able to help you. If you cant get a job and you really want one, I could hear around for general advice (e.g. advice on rxc3xa9sumxc3xa9, on job interview, etc.). , Sorry, the Internet default gender is male, hence the confusion. Makes sense why NoFap isnt a challenge now :P Aside from that, I kinda feel you might be giving up too soon on some things. Youre a good looking (based on description) 21 y/o woman, even if you were awkward as fuck youd end up with multiple dates. I understand your current situation sucks, and if I believed there was no hope, Id support you if you decided to end your life. But based on the conversation Im convinced there are still ways to get you better, and I cannot support you in not-considering these. I can however support you in finding ways to get you better, so let me know if youre open for that., If you do end up commiting suicide, the decision whether or not you write a note will be one of your last decisions in life. Its worth taking some time to think it through. Writing stuff down gives you a better idea whether or not your decision is 100% what you want. For example, if you try to write a good motivation for suicide, youre likely to discover some flaws in your logic; or some options you havent tried yet. These are worth trying - you want to commit suicide because you feel youve tried everything, meaning that if you havent tried everything you should try the other options. Its Tired likely that there are other options that you havent considered yet.Aside from that, Im not gonna try to talk you out of it. I dont know you and Im no psychic, so I cannot say youre an amazing  person and everything will be all right!.All I want to say about it is that youre main issue seems that you think youre out of options. Think that through.So, on the letter, some other advantages:* people will know it was not an impulsive decision. They will have an explanation, which might help them cope with the loss (trust me, youll almost certainly Pain people). * you can Pain people. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. , I want to start by clarifying *I dont disagree* with your reasoning. It has reached bestof, therefore I assume it applies to many people. I just want to give my *personal* answer on a question in your text.&gt; If delusion can fuel your well being, then whats wrong with giving into delusion? For me, truth and authenticity are higher values than *feeling happy*. Im not saying Depression is truth/not delusional, heck, I dont know squat about Depression. But when it comes to delusion vs happiness, I would rather kill myself than live a dilusional life. , Then you have to analyze your current situation and change whatever is giving you a hard time. There are always many many things you can change in life. Feeling like shit is the worst, but it does have one good thing - you have nearly nothing to lose. Change things based on what will help you on short term, no long term decisions. If you dont know what to change, just try random stuff. Learn something new (can help you with that); get really really drunk, do a game/movie marathon, ...Assuming youre looking for a job (since you said its kind of difficult for me to get a job), you have a lot of spare time. Fill it in as much as possible with varying activities. You might discover that you like something you didnt know.Another tip, try sports (for example, lifting weights). It can make a *huge* difference. A healthy body will make you feel better, even without things changing in your life. Aside from that - things will change if youre doing it right. If youre bodys in better shape, youll feel better about yourself and youll be happier (which doesnt mean its a requirement to be happy, its just something that works).Also something fun: challenge yourself and start /r/NoFap . I dont care if you want to do it, just do it, try it for 9 days. 9 days is nothing; you have nothing to lose, but you may discover a lot by no longer obeying nature (which youve probably done for years). After 9 days, you can do whatever you want (continue, stop, ...). ",Supportive,Supportive,Supportive
"I was expecting you to follow up on that title.  Ive found writing helps to get all my thoughts out so I can make more sense of them. I can write and think literally all day. Im analytical, everythings difficult to get down in my writing because each thought leads to something else, its like I want to paint the big picture but I can never do it all in so little words as people want me to. I always go off-topic. Dont take that as a bad thing when it happens to you, though.My strategy is to deal with things before I can feel bad about them. Should do it? Going to do it -&gt; Will do it. -&gt; Okay Im going to do it.  It validates logically too, it gets me in the frame of mind for dealing with it because I create a response, rather than waiting to deal with it.   Then again it varies with context. I just dont do phone calls period if I can avoid it.I stumbled into a homeless shelter about 3 years ago and Im still here, Depression and with my head down all the time, Tired Worried and generally debilitated. I wouldnt have occurred to me to write about my problem here or to phone any support line. Id shared a house and got increasingly worse Anxiety because Id dropped out of uni and then couldnt pay my rent share for most of the time. For about a year and a half I would respond with a yes or no to staff here. But I recovered, I made real progress eventually, even though I still isolate and spend all day online and dont want to have anything to do with real people apart from occasional interaction. I was in a constant fear/Anxiety of people, in particular a knock on a door or a bell/buzzer would set me off. Throughout school I hadnt sought mental health help, I was mostly silent, introverted, reflective.. ultimately it stems from my early family life, and feelings of abandonment, an Emotional upset shell.Anyway, some thoughts-1. Dont feel bad for not writing in the same structure as everyone else2. Consider your loved ones might be frustrated and not sure what else to do / not able3. Depression can be a symptom of underlying self-esteem, body image problems4. Have you tried blogging, to get your thoughts out? Or email drafts or something?5. Its okay to be a bad friend, its okay not to live up to expectations.Life isnt logical, but we can say of the world its far too complex to say we dont deserve a place here. From there we can work towards the specific problems we face and improve either our perception of the situation or how we respond to it, changing it.  Ideally a counselor will spend the time to go through the specifics, but theres plenty of stories about bad counselors.., The good thing about life is you can always start over. I watched 21 grams the other night, it really changed my perspective on life because I have existential issues of my own. Link here: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C86324FEFEC5B39You said you fucked up recently-  to me that sounds like different areas of life went wrong for you at the same time. Maybe theyve been long coming, and it seems so much to deal with at once. Having support can completely turn that around; I dont manage my living situation directly but I help towards it. Forms and bills that would overwhelm me are dealt with easily. I have people to talk to because they are professional staff. And its possible to move on from there to full independence, one step at a time.You might consider all the things you can do, all the experiences you havent had yet. Write a bucket list?Can you share specifics?I really think you should carefully consider all the options you have., Ive read your other posts so I know you mean well but I wish youd stop saying thinking is bad. If anything the chief cause of suicide is our poorly run, responsibility-denying money-worshipping society that fails to prepare us all for life period. For myself thinking is a way of analyzing what I am so that I can direct my life; its from confronting my internal behaviour and decisionmaking processes that I reason I can and should do something with my life at all. (or maybe even, I will only ever make decisions based on my long-term experience of wanting to have a function in society. I have to know this.)Thank you for yet another thoughtful and insightful post. Im appreciating them., On another thread/topic here, there was the phrase I dont know why I want to livehttp://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1h5n11/i_just_want_to_be_good_at_something/carbv3dTry thishttps://www.google.com/search?q=muscle+relaxation+Anxiety+youtubeI really dont know where to begin with your racing thoughts problem. Have you had a diagnosis? The fastest Ive had thoughts coming, it was useful for me, and I cant imagine anything faster than that. I think if you are having them extremely fast they cant be that useful. Ive had to use a camera to record myself talking about stuff as it comes to me, because Im particularly.. active at the moment. So many thoughts come to me every day, something like 100-200. Writing is the only way I can keep track, and building them into something constructive is helpful. (though the thoughts, about the nature of existence, trouble me and are nothing I can do much about)Possibly for you it has something to do with laying down a structure to your day; I know mine is unorganized and I feel burnt out a lot of the time as well as Depression sometimes. I am living in my head all day every day, thinking, weighing up and analyzing things, its not exhausting; it feels like the best way to live. I actually like not being able to tell what day it is. But the problem with that is it also invites Anxiety because I dont know where my life is going in the short-term. I always do this trailing-off-on-a-tangent thing. Maybe I should think more and write something coherent but I dont like to wait / waste time.I wouldnt ever say bad people dont deserve a place in the world. Rather people are the natural expression of the environment that surrounds/creates them.Im completely isolated from anyone at all. I might used to have said I lived and worked for the world; non-nationalism. But deconstructing all of my identity comes before saying such things. There are some things we can say about life however;- its all well ever have with which to do something of meaning, and our creation invites us to have some sort of function in the world. Whether or not its ultimately pointless or forgettable. Ultimately it can mean nothing in the bigger picture where were less than 1% of the universe; a grossly immature organization of creatures on a tiny planet harboring egos that seek to undermine our significance. But we are not logical creatures. People dont usually have these thoughts, and that is the rough consensus/standard for sanity.&gt;I think its more that I dont want it.But there is in all possibility many future places where youd say you do want it. So the general therapists task is to get you to enjoy some small things in your life, get you enjoying it a little more. What kind of person doesnt want to enjoy life? And rationalizations towards the opposite of enjoying life will come from not enjoying it.  I know I have thoughts that conflict at different *levels* of my existence, but even as a thinker it comes down to what I feel like doing in the end. Its most difficult to do things against what you feel. So feeling is key. And especially for Anxiety, a lack of positive associations with bodily or environmental sensations/stimuli is what drives our reactions to it rather than logic.  So basically I will always have an aversion to people because I was rarely ever hugged as a child and b/c I isolated throughout my entire school life.  But I spend my time on things I enjoy, youtube, learning/reading, gaming/programming, a digital life in general. The good outweighs the bad. And thats how people live.I liked thishttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amkrPkcg3XU, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu5oaty0uJM, Tell her you love her and want to keep her in your life, that you want to support her and get her through this, that you will listen to her always.  Tell her you want her to at least discuss this with you in detail to be sure its the right choice.  That this is such an important decision for her and you want to help all you can.Is she getting any support from her family? What other people would be suitable to contact that wouldnt put too much Pressure on her (with her permission)?, If she can drop you that easily despite what youve had, all you can do is forget her and move on. What good is obsessing over her? Even if she came back, she could go again at the drop of a hat, fucking you up even further. Your best choice is to shut her out of your life completely and deal with being alone.Its difficult when on the rebound. What you want is to be stable, which means not starting another relationship. Re. this one-  stand your ground now that youve been betrayed, as a form of self-respect if nothing else. You have to respect yourself above others. You have to be harsh on yourself at times to make the Pain less in the long run. Being comfortable with being alone is better before being a relationship. Then you arent so distraught when someone goes, and you have other coping methods.Relationships are never perfect the first time. Wed love them to be, but the secret is you have to be prepared to be open with every person you get involved with, to learn more about yourself and whats really healthy for you. Eventually you find someone, in theory, that meets expectations, but why should it be easy? How could it be easy?This isnt the end of the world. You in fact have every single option that was ever possible at this point. You can distract yourself with something positive, something rewarding. You can find friends and even a partner again, in time. But accept the reality: this is over; any deep bond of trust has been broken. The best thing you can do for your future self is pick up the pieces sooner rather than later. Alcohol/drugs wont help., Find an adult at school or even the police, explain your situation, they should set you up with someone that will listen to you and not judge you, work out your options from there. Dont be afraid to ask for help. As another poster says you may be able to get time off from school, you need guidance and support because you are being bullied. Bullying hurts on the inside too not just the outside, its Tired serious if you are made to feel suicidal. Please ask an adult for help., I hope you get a diagnosis, this is really important to be able to communicate to your family you have a legitimate struggle not an excuse or laziness.You are here, and you have a potential to enjoy life, which trumps a logical analysis of wanting or not wanting. You dont choose to live, nobody did, but we discover who we can be as a result, and whether we find difficulty there, that can be seen as completely separate. Its okay to be in trouble and in need of help. Its human and common and normal. If you are here for others then maybe its not so much to ask of yourself to try anything that will work, to help yourself up. It can be difficult to believe in yourself but its possible, its always possible to move on from where we are and there is no shame in that., &gt;I dont know why I want to live.I felt this way last year. Existential questions are Tired important to some of us while for others its never a concern, and the thinking is expected to be dealt with some other way within this responsibility-dodging society. Most lines of thought arent approached by therapists because they of course have stable lives in the economic system; dont see a need to question it. Most people in the world in fact cant offer up the experience to handle these questions, so theyll pretend theyre not important(!)Since we dont have a lot of space here, possibly ask yourself1. why you are driven to ask this in particular2. if your line of thought could be biased by being in this position3. if youd find a more certain answer by first becoming happy with yourself4. if you can be content with being who you are5. if its okay to live every day with being ugly, a failure, or poor, or homeless, or blind etc.6. if you would try to put everything right, given the chanceFor what its worth I still think along those lines (death today vs. tomorrow) every day even though my living situation and life in general isnt such a problem for me right now. And I have to ask myself why Im posting here. But thats me and my existential worries, my loneliness and lack of social life &amp; distraction talking. Distraction is the key word. Its the secret to how people never stumble across the big question. More tasty food, more nice clothes, and so on.Environmental damage is something close to 0% of the people of the world are conscious of. Why be part of that low percentile? Its happening anyway whether you care about it or not: this is the world thats been created and its the world thats here to stay.Really, these rationalizations are coming from having nothing to live for that youre excited about in the short-term. And by no means does that mean that they cant appear again. People do not break. The mind is Tired flexible and adaptable. Its possible to fix your environment, therefore its possible you can be happier with life. That question never disappears completely.Everything with your life can be improved if youre serious; all its ever concerned is the method, knowledge, skills that you apply.",Behavior,Behavior,Supportive
"Thats the only thing keeping me from offing myself. It would tear my family apart at the seams. Id go somewhere secluded and actually do the act, but theyd learn about it and it would wreck my mother and father. I cant be responsible for ruining their lives any more than I already have, Bingo.Ive accepted that the only girl Ill ever love is gone. I understand that shes moved on and has no need for me. That doesnt make this mind-numbing Ache stop or give me any solace during every sleepless night. , I failed this past semester too, my friend.

Everything sucks.I want to tell you not to do it and I want to say theres a light at the end of the tunnel for guys Hyperactive behavior you and me. But, in all honestly, I feel the same as you. Take solace in that, in that you arent alone and Im suffering the same as you. I hope it gets better, and when it does, I want the both of us to be around to enjoy it. College sucks anyway. Its basically a 4 year slumber party for sluts and douchebags, were better off not being in an environment that promotes that kind of Mental Depression. I was thinking of picking up a trade or joining the Firefighters Academy. Search your  mind and see if theres anything at all that interests you, and follow it. Life is absurd, but might as well roll with the punches, yeah? Who knows when well strike gold... or get struck by lightning. Might as well find out though., People who make generalizations Hyperactive behavior that are ignorant trash and deserve to have their teeth kicked down their throat. To be so callous and undervalue the magnitude of peoples suffering Hyperactive behavior that just boggles my mind. , Oh, absolutely. Its comparable to feeling Hyperactive behavior Im drowning all the time. I do the best I can, I kick my legs and try to reach the surface, only for the riptide to pull me back down under and the vicious struggle continues. Im so rooted in my misery and used to feeling this way, I dont even have expectations anymore. And yet, the universe continues to find ways to make me feel worse as every day passes. Its so cruel I almost want to laugh. , Welcome to the land of heartbreak, my friend. Where life goes completely black, food has no taste, and Hypersomnia is a thing of the past. I lost my girlfriend about 3 months ago. We were together for 3 years, 3 beautiful, magical years. Much Hyperactive behavior you, my girlfriend said she wanted space. Space turned into a break, which turned into a break-up. Not long after, I discovered she had been cheating on me for over half the relationship and she started dating him Hyperactive behavior 3 days after breaking up with me. I still havent recovered, and Ive come to accept I never will. But there are ways to momentarily distract yourself. Get a hobby and wholly dedicate yourself to it. I picked skateboarding back up, which is something I dropped at her request early in the relationship. Devote yourself to whatever you choose. I suggest joining a gym because exercise promotes endorphin release and all that, lots of Netflix and reading, I immediately bought a PS4 and some new games. Shit Hyperactive behavior that, you know.I know the sheer agony youre feeling. I was so bad, that for the first month, whenever I would think of her with her new boyfriend, it would literally make me sick. Its pure hell, I know... and sadly, the only solace I can offer is that it goes from feeling Hyperactive behavior youre constantly being bludgeoned in the head with a sledgehammer, to feeling Hyperactive behavior youre constantly being shocked with a live wire. I wish you luck, my friend. These will be the toughest months of your life ahead. , I did not, I didnt even arrange the meeting. I was sent to her by my advisor at school after learning of my being kicked out of college recently.My apologies for not making this clear in my original post. , Id absolutely love to kill myself. If it werent for my mother, I definitely would have by now. In Drug abuse school, I was forced to attend counseling and mentioned Suicide to the psychiatrist. She mentioned it to my mother, who on the car ride home, mentioned if I ever killed myself she would follow suit. That would tear apart my family, send my father spiraling into Mental Depression, etc. I cant be responsible for all of that, so Im stuck on this Depressed mood ride until she dies and I can kill myself, or I die in an accident of some sort.Ive been down that path of trying to make the best of life. I work out twice daily and have been for a couple years, it doesnt do much for me anymore and the rest of the things you mentioned suck. The only thing I truly love doing is skateboarding, but theres snow on the ground and has been for months so no dice there. Even when theres not, its not enough to make me want to live. I dont think you understand, man. Theres something inherently wrong with my brain. I genuinely desire death and I have felt this way since I was 13 or 14. I dont function as a normal human should, I have thoughts of harming myself and doing bad things constantly. No amount of therapy has helped, no drugs, no stay in the hospital, nothing. Im what you would refer to as a lost cause. I dont even want to get better anymore, I just want to die. It would be so amazing to just not be alive. , Thats an excellent articulation of how I feel as well. That was wonderfully written. , This is beautifully articulated and I empathize incredibly. I, too, failed this last semester of college. My Mental Depression has worsened since attending school, and it makes me feel Hyperactive behavior an even bigger failure that Ive wasted my familys resources and faith.It would be amazing to just go to Hypersomnia permanently, but damn this insomnia. , I would gladly trade with my life with one of those kids dying.

By that time, I figure Ill have hit critical mass and Vaginal Eczema to die even more than I do now. I truly wish people would accept this, some of us just genuinely dont want to exist anymore. When the bad outweighs the good and the Ache becomes unbearable, its only fair we be given the chance to let go. , I have. I remember when in eighth grade, my baseball team made it to the state tournament. It was the last inning, we were down by Hyperactive behavior 5 or 6 runs, and I was the last to bat. I go to bat, listen to everyone screaming my name and relish in it, only to strike out on 3 straight pitches, I believe. And I remember feeling so Depressed mood on the bus ride home and thinking, Whatever, Ill just kill myself. I always subconsciously thought it, but never outwardly voiced it myself until then. And ever since, its always my fallback. Every since I lost my girlfriend, I think of it multiple times a day. In a weird way, it makes me feel better. Like, no matter how bad things get I always have an out and, until the day I decide to pull the trigger, its almost Hyperactive behavior a game. To see how much bullshit I can take from life before throwing in the towel. I have a feeling my time is almost up. I give myself til the anniversary of our break-up date before I fully come undone and jump off this roller coaster called life., Thats totally untrue; theres absolutely no guarantee that anybody feels anything for you.

You ever peruse the FA sub or the SuicideWatch one? Couldnt tell you how many people writhe in isolation everyday. Life coming at a cost is also horseshit. I didnt ask for life, and I do not want it. That would be Hyperactive behavior me parking a Ferrari in your garage, then demanding you pay for it simply because it has a cost. Id say its pretty arrogant to assume what you have. Not all of us are lucky enough to have the things you assert in your conjecture, nor can we control the way we feel. One of the many reasons existing is a Ache in the ass and I demand exit. , To be frank, I really dont. I sort of drone on only because of a curiosity of what happens next. This existence is a joke when you get down to it, but a lot of odd and unusual things can occur... so I treat it Hyperactive behavior a game, in a sense. Im just rolling the dice, and whether I get hit by a car or win the lottery, who cares? At least theres something going on.I pass my time in several ways, though. Video games, working out, Netflix, nerf basketball hoop in my room, writing Dragon Ball Z stories, lots of naps... just anything to take my mind off of the endless cycle of torture and bleakness. It seems to mostly do the job., Man, this got me all choked up. Cant tell you how nice it is to hear this and I really needed it today.I love you too man, thanks for posting this. I love all you guys, this sub is my home. , Its funny, because Im at the same place Hyperactive behavior once a week. I usually end up rubbing one out, downing a Totinos pizza, then passing out of the couch after playing PS4 til my eyes bleed. , Death is the only comfort I have Ventricular Dysfunction, Left. When Im laying in my bed at night and cant Hypersomnia, which is basically every night, I think about nothing but how Ill die. I make my own funeral arrangements, create mental letters for my family, think about what Id do the day before dying. Stuff Hyperactive behavior that. Really makes me feel better. I look forward immensely to dying., I wont give you meaningless platitudes and say not to do it, but just to be sure. I understand the Ache you feel in losing someone you loved; I, too, lost the love of my life and the girl I treasured more than any other. Now life is just... hollow. Its not worth waking up every morning. Good luck to you whatever you choose, but know that no matter what, you were never alone. People just Hyperactive behavior you and me are suffering the same all across the world, and theres a certain sense of togetherness in there somewhere. Hopefully you can take some heart in that. , Definitely hits close to home. Sleep is one of the few escapes I have, thats why I do it as often as I can. If Im not working or at the gym, you can either find me sleeping or laying on my bed. Its a running joke with my co-workers. I have these immense, deep bags under my eyes and people are amazed by it because I Hypersomnia ~13 hours a day. Im just really Exhaustion, I say as they laugh and call me Raccoon. If they only could see the thoughts in my head, theyd understand why I have to Hypersomnia. Being Wakefulness hurts too much., Being a psychopath isnt so bad, my only genuine friend is a clinically diagnosed psychopath. Despite the stigma, hes actually a really cool guy. Had a therapist in Drug abuse school suggest I was one too. I think theres more of em than people realize. Sometimes I think of similar things too, especially when Im bored or agitated. Happened today actually.Overheard a guy tell somebody that he wants to beat the fuck out of me, so I spent most of the day picturing myself setting him on fire or putting C4 under his car. Granted he does have a pretty legit reason for feeling how he does, but still. Regardless, I think a lot of Depressed mood people feel this way. Its only Hypothermia, natural humans find an escape to alleviate their Mental Depression, and this is ours. , Got that right, OP. Just Exhaustion of it all.My emotions bounce from complete indifference at my life, then jump to Abnormal dreams fury because I hate how all of this is happening to me and I had no say in it, then I go back to being Numbness again. Usually theres some soul-crushing sadness and pangs of Guilt riddled in there somewhere. Its all so exhausting, I just cant wait to die already. , Im truly sorry to hear that. I cant offer you much besides the knowledge that I feel very much the same as you. Granted Im only 22, but there is no looking up for me. This is the first Valentines Day in 3 years without my ex. Just move on, people have been saying for about 6 months now. Its not happening because she was the one. I know it and theres no moving on from that. Shes in the arms of another while Im dining on my guts, back to being completely alone. I, too, have no friends, no family, nobody. While my eternal love is doing who knows what with her boyfriend, Im here toiling in misery. Going to spend yet another night utterly void of her, living on the memories of what we used to have, and playing PS4 til my eyes bleed. Do what we can, right?, Teenage years are far and away the worst. Peaking during adolescence would worthy of true pity. Im 22, and my teenager years blew. So have the 20s so far,  but it only makes everything worse if you tack on other peoples expectations and projections and take them as your own. Everyone lives their own life and theres no rule that says teenager years are the greatest. Maybe if youre a drunken nympho youll enjoy that time more, but thats all I can think of., Within the last year or so, Ive also discovered this. Im at my absolute worst when Im Ventricular Dysfunction, Left alone with my thoughts- thats when all the blackened emotions come out and the smallest of things become triggers for an episode. Wish I could just turn my thoughts completely off, or at least lower the volume so I could drown them out with a mixtape or something., Yeah, thats the only reason Im still alive. I mentioned Suicide once before in my teens and my mom said shed kill herself if I ever attempted to do it.So, Im effectively responsible for both of our lives and I really hate her for it. , I actually thrive on that praise. I go out of my way to try and impress people, to try and escape the black cloud over my head and have someone, somewhere, not think Im this husk that I feel Hyperactive behavior inside. , Believe me, I understand more than anyone. My girlfriend was at one time so controlling and jealous, when she found out I was alone with my half-sister, she freaked the fuck out on me and started having a Panic Attacks attack over the phone. Yet, she was the one cheating and I got Ventricular Dysfunction, Left. Funny how it works, isnt it? We should start a club or something. , You know, I was just mulling this over myself today at work. I have both a superiority and inferiority complex. I constantly compare myself to everyone, check every mirror and reflective surface, have to be the best at everything. A weirdly vicious cycle. Im far and away the most braggadocios, arrogant guy youll ever meet, but at the same time, the most absolute timid and insecure. Boggles my own mind. , Exactly. Just because others have it worse in no way lessens my own problems nor does it have any bearing on the glaring issues to start with. If this is all it took for people to stop being Depressed mood, it would be a very easy condition to fix., I know the unbearable Ache of losing the girl you love more than anything to some other guy. Like the gentlemen said in another thread, its Hyperactive behavior constantly being touched by a live wire. The sheer agony is unbearable. Since she Ventricular Dysfunction, Left, I second guess my every move. I have no confidence, no hopes, no dreams, nothing but this searing Ache and Anger at myself for letting everything fall apart. My mental health worsens by the day. She took my sanity when she Ventricular Dysfunction, Left. Im a few months in now, myself. People have been saying, Oh, it gets better. Youll find another, shell be meaningless soon, but thats a bold-faced lie and I hate that people say it. Let me know if you find anything that works or lessons that Ache, otherwise, a five dollar rope doesnt sound Hyperactive behavior a bad idea at all anymore..., Me neither, Ive even got a personal bet going with myself. I give myself roughly 4-5 more months before my stability hits a proverbial absolute 0 and I bite the bullet, both literally and figuratively. If I lose the bet, Ill do something extravagant Hyperactive behavior sporadic trip somewhere or buy a new car that I cant afford. If I win the bet, then Im gone and I finally escaped this torture. Hoping I win. , Eh, I survived. Pulled an eight hour day at work and apparently my co-workers husband told another one of my co-workers that he wants to fight me. Not sure why, but it kind of makes me happy my existence can elicit SOME kind of emotion. Have mixed feelings towards the weekend. My birthday is on Sunday and I turn 23, but its my first one since my girlfriend Ventricular Dysfunction, Left me. Her birthday is the day before, this Saturday. I keep thinking about how shell spend it with her new boyfriend while I lay Wakefulness and miss her terribly all night. That part really sucks.Plan on doing something for it, though Im not sure yet. Find it almost ironic my birthday falls on Easter. , I feel very similarly to that. For most of my Mental Depression, I felt Abnormal dreams hatred, much Hyperactive behavior you do, for people and life in general. It sucked and was Hyperactive behavior a Depressed mood roller coaster I couldnt get off of, causing me to hate it all the more and the vicious circle continued.Now Im pretty much as apathetic as they come. I stopped hating things about a year ago and gave up completely on life a few months ago. Things most certainly will not just magically get better and this keep on trucking mantra has proved to be complete bullshit, at least in my case. I cant offer you much solace other than that- knowing I think this place sucks just as much as you do. I dont have a solution, as Im going through life with my hands in my pockets and nothing more, but who knows what will happen? Maybe Jessica Alba will call me and offer to fuck my brains out tomorrow, or some stranger will throw me the keys to his Lambo. Might as well see. , I plan on doing the same in the next couple weeks. Maybe Ill see you on the other side, we can grab a drink and talk about how Depressed mood life was. Godspeed, my friend. , For what its worth, I understand you completely. My girlfriend Ventricular Dysfunction, Left me for another guy and I know how soul-wrenching that is. I failed out of school, which makes me feel Hyperactive behavior a colossal piece of shit. My biggest outlet in life was always skateboarding, but its winter and theres no indoor skate park within 50 miles so thats out of the question. No friends, my only real family is cancer-stricken, and my job sucks. Hopefully it helps knowing you arent alone. Im right there suffering alongside you. I dont know if it will get any better for us, but I do know I want to be around if it does and the world will be lesser without people Hyperactive behavior us in it. Society needs dissenters Hyperactive behavior you and me, we make shit interesting., Breaking Benjamin - Dear AgonyI cant put my finger exactly on why, but that song is my Kryptonite... in a good way. Everything Im feeling settles down and the Muscular Stiffness sets in and Im okay for the time being.  , I very much feel the same as you. Ive hit a point in my Mental Depression where its become more Indifferent mood than anything, and in a roundabout way, theres really some beauty in it. Life can be such an absurd pile of shit, so what the hell is the point is trying? Ive certainly yet to find one, but perspective can shift Hyperactive behavior that.I guess it works in a nothing Ventricular Dysfunction, Left to lose kind of light. Nothing is off limits when you think about it. In my head, everything is up for grabs and Im more or less just curious what happens next. Maybe Ill get to bang a supermodel or maybe Ill get struck by lightning. Who knows. I certainly feel for you, OP. Youre not alone. , Ive done everything humanly possible to fix my problems and myself, but I come no closer no matter how hard I try. I guess that counts for something. Doesnt change anything, but it takes a special person to struggle through it anyway and we can say that if nothing else. Whatever fleeting happiness, or at least equanimity, comes my way, Ill take in stride. But Im not gonna pretend theres a rainbow beyond the black cloud that follows me any longer. Im at peace with it, or at least Im getting there., Nothing takes a toll on a persons psyche Hyperactive behavior a relationship, eh? I know how you feel. I was with my girlfriend for 3 years. 3 beautiful years, or at least to me they were. Then one day... she Ventricular Dysfunction, Left. Got with some other guy, blocked my number, pretended I didnt exist. It aggravated my Mental Depression and suicidal thoughts to a degree I didnt know possible. The kicker is always thinking of her, isnt it? Certainly was for me. 24/7, no matter what I was doing. Working, lifting, skating, watching a movie, with another girl, or just jerking off alone in my room. Couldnt stop thinking of her. Solid 2 months of that passed. Best advice I can give on that is to condition yourself to not think about her or what shes doing. When she pops up in your brain, IMMEDIATELY do something. What I would do is drop down and bang out as many push-ups as I could, even when I was in public or at the mall or what have you. I was waiting in line for a TV on Black Friday and did well over 300 push-ups from all the waiting and thinking of her I did. Got to the point where push-ups filled my brain, and not her. Whats more, it makes you look awesome and its a great way to meet chicks in public.At least you can be thankful she didnt come back and abuse your love for her. My ex came back into my life about 3 weeks ago, crying to me because her life sucks without me I guess. She feels alone, her new boyfriend is a dick, and she misses me. But, she wont leave him for me. Shes using me for emotional stability and our physical connection, but wont come back to me. And Im back to square 1, Depressed mood and suicidal. Take heart where you can. After theyve been gone, you dont want them back. Youll end up Hyperactive behavior me, a prisoner of your own love. Pathetic? Absolutely. Does it matter? Not a bit. Best of luck, friend. , I much feel the same. After losing my girlfriend of 3 years to a sub-human piece of shit and finding out she cheated on me with that douche after I tried so hard in the relationship, I realized Im pretty much unlovable. Ive come to think relationships just arent meant for some people, and Im certainly one.Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I dont want to give you Depersonalization platitudes. Invest in yourself, concern yourself only with your own affairs and the rest is irrelevant. There are positives to this type of life- no fighting, no worrying, no distrust, no stupid plans on Christmas, no more blowout arguments, etc. May not sound ideal, but it keeps me sane. Kind of. , Every single night of my life. , That genuinely made me laugh. Thanks. , Sucks how true this. I made a lighthearted remark about it to a co-worker after he heard I failed my last semester of college. The dude told me, change your tampon and find your missing dick and balls., I know that feeling, as I feel very much the same. As much as I would Hyperactive behavior to stop existing, I just couldnt cause it myself. Ideally for me, Id Hyperactive behavior something or someone else to do me in. Like a passive death wish. Maybe a sniper could take me out while Im walking down the street, or I could jump into a house fire and save someone before the house collapses on me. Something Hyperactive behavior that.As far as distracting yourself, I know how tough that is. No matter what I do, those black thoughts are in my head. As soon as the movie is done or I leave the gym, they come back full force. Its deafening. Dont have much helpful advice, except it takes a strong person to not give in and we walk this road together. I hope therapy works for you. , Every time I hear somebody say its Muscle Weakness or that Mental Depression sufferers just dont have the will or the grit to push forward, I get the same feeling. Its sickening how unfeeling and utterly repugnant some people can be.Would love nothing more than to elbow those pieces of shit in the throat til I cant raise my arm anymore., Oh, I do this all the time. Started off as me dying heroically, Hyperactive behavior saving a couple kids from a burning building or going out on some other Batman-esque act of courage.  Then I would be honored posthumously and people would finally respect me. It was a way for me to cope and validate to myself and everyone else that I was of value. Now I imagine myself dying just because it makes me feel better. Snipers in random trees aiming for my head, an 18 wheeler t-boning me on a walk, getting robbed and shot when Im paying for gas, all kinds of weird stuff Hyperactive behavior that. Just the other day when I couldnt Hypersomnia (as always), I fantasized about being taken hostage at a bank and being the guy used as a bargaining chip. Then just taking one of their guns and Panic myself so they have no leverage, just to be a jerk. Im incredibly twisted, I know. , Im always afraid to admit that to myself. That maybe the reason Im so driven to be better than everyone and think Im so godly is because deep down, I know Im as Muscle Weakness as I perceive other people to think I am. My ex girlfriend fell for it. She thought I was Gods gift to mankind, and when the Anger inside me eventually showed, she split and my mental health has vastly deteriorated. I wonder how much of that love I felt for her was actually genuinely for her, or because she fed my so ego so greatly, and now that its gone, I have no validation of my superiority., She did, and it made things all the worse. She was my fiance and my truest love for 3 years. She ended up moving away, cheating on me, and leaving for some other guy.A couple weeks ago, she came back to my door crying. Begging me for another chance, telling me she had nothing without me, etc. But, the kicker is, I know shes using me. She tells me she wants me, yet she wont leave her boyfriend. Fills my head and my heart with promises and Ive become what I despise most, a cheater, because Im simply Drug abuse to her.I cant leave, I cant stay. I cant talk to her because she blows up and threatens to kill herself, I cant ignore it because it tears my soul out. Its truly a mindfuck. I was very close to being over her before she returned, but now Im back to square 1 and I cant go through it again. , Ah, do I know this all too. I lost my girlfriend of 3 years about... 6-7 months ago, Id say. She had a new boyfriend Hyperactive behavior 2 or 3 weeks later. It crushed me, literally knocked the wind out of me and I thought I was dying. Room got all fuzzy, stomach felt Hyperactive behavior it was being ripped out... yikes. Now? Well, it still hurts Hyperactive behavior Abnormal behavior but in a different way. At first its Hyperactive behavior constantly being stabbed in the chest with a sharp knife. Lot of rampant guilt, sleepless nights, nothing really matters. These days... its more Hyperactive behavior being continuously shocked with a live wire. Still a lot of sleepless nights, but you learn to adapt. Its Hyperactive behavior you almost get bored of the immense heartbreak and it just turns to this weird Yeah, I ruined my life. Whatever kind of feeling. As for your actual question, I contemplate it every day of my life. I teeter on the edge of whether I should swallow the barrel of a gun and silence my aching head or just crawl back in bed and hope tomorrow isnt as bad... which it seemingly always is. If you ever need anybody to speak to about this subject, Im here. I Hyperactive behavior to think of myself as a bit of an expert at this particular topic., All things heal in time - Clearly they dont otherwise Id be just dandy by now. In fact, the opposite seems to be true.She Ventricular Dysfunction, Left you months ago. Why arent you over her? Why dont you move on? - Ive tried so hard. Dont you think I WANT to be over the girl that ripped my beating heart out of my chest? I meant the promises I made to her and its not something I can just forget. You should be thankful you arent dead or dying - Itd be easier if I was, but thanks for regurgitating this fallacy, you dick. These thought-terminating cliches piss me off beyond words.Why dont you see a professional and get some medication? - What a revolutionary thought. Ive only been down this avenue every year since I was 11. Clearly it didnt work. Dont give up. Things will get better if you try - That is a banality and a meaningless platitude. It offers nothing to me and is borderline insulting. Do you think I enjoy this suffering and inescapable mindset? Just get over it - Fuck you. , Agreed exponentially. High school sucked for me, college is arguably even worse, and this entire real world idea is just some propaganda perpetuated by older people from an entirely different time, I find. Its all meaningless when you get down to it. Nothing has ever just magically disappeared when it comes to Mental Depression; Ive yet to hear of one person wake up and say, You know, Im not Depressed mood anymore. Im 100% happy. Outstanding.I think it means whatever you experience just carries over and gives you a scaffolding for every endeavor in your life. I was a Depressed mood loner in junior Drug abuse, which carried over to Drug abuse school, which has carried over to college and my jobs, which will follow me everywhere. Thats what Ive gotten from it, at least. , This comment is exactly how I felt, plus it made me chuckle. Thanks, friend. , Perception is reality. ",Ideation,Behavior,Indicator
"No you are not bothering anyone. View it like this: if you were bothering, would there be a subreddit only for people like you? , Thanks :), Nobody will say that to you if you dont have anybody to talk to, I dont think it would be a good idea to make it pay-to-visit. I think it would scare away a lot of people who need help. We could make it ad-based, it wouldnt make much money but enough to power the servers.And the real-life-meeting wont work in the first weeks, because if there are just for example 1000 people who use that website they wont be all over the world. We already have luck when there are two who speak the same language.Im trying to start now but I cant promise anyhting.I just need a name to start, any suggestions?, I need it because of the chat function. But even when everybody only brags about the good moments in their lifes, I realize that I havent got any of this good moments, Im sorry that Im only able to give the two standard answers, but from my experience they really help:At first, if you dont do already, talk about everything. Everything you want to talk about (or even dont want to talk about)My other recommendation is the butterfly project: http://butterfly-project.tumblr.com/ for example she could do it with your name.I hope I could help a little bit. Take care of each other :), Please tell us youre still there. Talk with us! Please..., Please tell us you are still alive! Nothing in this world is bad enough to kill yourself! Talk to us, it will help!, First of all: why would you want to do that? There are many things worth living for. Do you have any specific problems? Do you want to talk about them with the community / me?There is no easy way to die and even when its easy for you, its horrible for other people., yes that would be a nice idea but it requires a lot of work, I hope Ill start tomorrow after school. Do you have any ideas for a name? I am sorry to say that but I see follwing problems in this idea, although I would like to work with it:1. A domain costs money, around a few $/month and the free servers are likely to crash every few days.2. Then, how should they contact? I owuld suggest adding multiple options like skype/reddit/phone/kik/etc.3. What about privacy?4. Maybe there are some idiots who want to harm other - already self-harming - people.5. I would need somebody to do the translation as my English isnt as good as it should be.What if, instead of meeting, we just offer a country based, skype/reddit/etc. adress book so that everyone in for example Germany gets the skype ID from somebody else in Germany?, I just found out that there already is an app for that: TalkLife on Google Play (didnt check on App Store), Hey :)I think Im in a smiliar situation as you. Do you have any reasons for being depressed? I know this question sounds dumb since there arent always reasons when you have a Depression, but if you have reasons, feel free to talk about it, the community and I will listen to you.And take a look on the positive sides: You wrote that a lot of people think your Depression gets better, so there are people who care about you. You should pick one or two of them and just talk openly about your problems and you will probably see how much they care about you. And if (what I hope you dont do) really kill yourself, they will be destroyed and maybe get a Depression themselves. Do you want the people who care about you fell the way you feel?Now for the self-hamring part: I too have been self harming for months. I suggest you the butterfly project: http://butterfly-project.tumblr.com/ It has really helped me although I cant promise that it helps everybody but its definitiely worth trying it.Tl;dr: Talk about your problems :), I dontt know why, this song always cheers me up alittle bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqgHosrqJ8o, Thank you, that are great names :), Hello :)do you have reasons for thinking like this? did anything happen that makes you think like this? do you want to talk about it? The community and I will be here for you.:), At first: thank you for seeking help on here. Do you have any reasons for your suicide thoughts? you should talk about the reasons, the community and I will be here for you.Just dont do anything you will regret later.:), yeah but I see them in their successful moments and realize I havent got any successful moments, My problem is not that people on social media are cunts, they are much more successful than me and that makes me feel bad, carry her to the next car and drive her to the hospital. if you are not stron enough ask f.neightbours to help you. Or just call 911, Just dont kill yourself. You have something to live for: Your cat! Just imagine what it would be like to her if her best friend wouldnt be there anymore.
